Reddit,"Quiet, but good restaurants",deleted,"1) Whytes Coffee in lake city. It is honestly one of the calmest places I’ve been to, it's almost always empty and there's even a cozy little study corner, food is great aswell. 
2) Second Cup near Readings (opposite mall 1) is also a great option but only if you sit upstairs. Downstairs can get a bit noisy and crowded but not many people head up, so it stays really peaceful. 
3) Chaye Khana, johar town. If bright lights bug you, this one’s great. The lighting is soft and it has a relaxing and artsy atmosphere. That said, the food at Chaye Khana isn’t that good so probably not the best place to eat but if you’re in the mood for kashmiri chai, it’s definitely worth a try.

Reddit,Dating,HiddenCompetition,"The truth is that a lot of women in Pakistan feel apprehensive about being catfished and having their personal information and photos compromised. Moreover, the idea of going out with a stranger alone is extremely daunting for most women in the country. As a woman myself, I can attest to feeling hesitant to meet people on dating apps until I was certain that they were trustworthy and that I was safe from any harm or danger. 
 However, despite these challenges, I was fortunate to have met my husband on Bumble and we are now happily married. We started as friends, dated for several months, and when we both felt comfortable and ready, we took the next step. So, if you are looking for love on dating apps, don't lose hope!

 People who live here have families, relatives, social and economic ties as well. 
 it is a beautiful place, yes the weather could be far from ideal any day of the given year we have good clear days most of the year. 
 People eat at home, outside food is/has always been a no-go for a lot of reasons (which I can’t care to elaborate further) 
 City is expanding because every day thousands upon thousands move here from smaller cities and towns, the city has always lifted them up to be able to afford housing and basic means of transportation (unlike your high horse) 
 Population is an issue, only in overcrowded places, most people just don’t go there! Like you said it is a vast land area and constantly expanding you can literally move into a different locality the one that suits you. 
 Who needs places when you have good people, friends and family around you? We always had Nani ka ghar, Khala k ghar and so on. Never ever wanted to go to Caesars Palace for a bit of Gambling fun for the family! If you’re feeling like it anyways go to joyland - we have that - lol. 
 are you familiar with an invention called AC, you should try it sometimes, even cars have it, buses these days have it, metro train has it, most of all the places like banks, restaurants etc have it.

 Try Bundu khan DHA, Fortress, Gadaffi stadium branch. Good ambience and food. 
 Bistro 201 upper mall. Call them and have a table reserved for you with rose petals and red baloons etc. You will have to pay maybe 1500 to 2000 rs for this decoration. Hold as much hands as you want after that. 
 Another decent restaurant is Bon Vivant Palais in gulberg 3 where you have 3 floors of different cuisines and you have privacy and decent crowd. 
 You can also go to any hip place in DHA. Nisa sultan, nandos, cafe alanto (wahan tou alcohol bhe chalti hai). The more expensive the restaurant the less you have to worry about stares etc. But having said that try to be comfortable in holding your mates hands wherever.

You'll really enjoy going through Mall Road, Canal Road, Jail Road and Gulberg. Lahore Cantt. is also really beautiful. Lahore overall has a lot of greenery, which you'll definitely appreciate since you're from Karachi. You'll find the city more clean and traffic a little better than Karachi. We now have the largest mall of Pakistan - Dolmen Mall in DHA Phase 6, so if you can try to visit that, you should. Be street smart about things as that is always going to come in handy, no matter where you're traveling. 
 Desi food and street food scene in Lahore does not even come close to Karachi's. You'll find good food at places like Rina's Kitchenette, Paola's Cosa Nostra, Mad Italian, etc. Since you're solo traveling, I don't know if you will be able to try those places. Beef burgers are also good here. Avoid desi food as much as you can. 
 Obviously, this is based on my own experience of Lahore and how I have come to interact with the city. Maybe a little more relevant for you because I'm from Karachi too and have moved here for good... because just look at the city, man - serene!

 Lahori food is basically versatile, a mix of Chinese, American, Italian (pastas, pizzas etc) and Indian.. 
 One of the reasons i think is because our ingredients are generally in medium to low quality so there has to be some sort of spice or masking agent (tadka, masala, fry/oil, raita etc) to make it edible.

This is awesome especially for your first venture in the restaurant world. The On2Cook system ( www.on2cook.com ) seem to be a perfect match for your needs. It significantly reduces cook times by approximately 70% meaning faster turnaround time. It's quite compact and fits in a small space but surprisingly, it can produce an impressive number of portions per hour. It's economical both in terms of capital and operation, and can replace many devices like oven, grill, microwave, etc. It's a smart, IoT-enabled device which provides automation and multi-site control right from the beginning. You can also be creative with your menu as it's flexible and you can literally cook anything from frozen to plate in only 3-6 minutes. And the best part, it maintains the food's quality and reduces waste.

Reddit,I make amazing food and want to open an expensive restaurant,Zaptail,"🍓 Pakistani Strawberry Cream Cheese Trifle Dessert :) 
 Servings 
 4 generous portions 
 
 Ingredients 
 Base Layer (Cake): 
 1 box Peek Freans Cake Up Strawberry Cupcakes (6 to 8 pcs as u like, they made them economically sized now so u might need more if u need), broken into bite-sized chunks 
 Custard Layer: 
 4 tbsp Vanilla Custard Powder any brand you like 
 3 cups (750 ml) milk of your preference 
 2 egg yolks (Odorless eggs from grocery store) 
 Pure Stevia powder (nocal brand) or sugar to taste 
 ½ cup (100 g) Cream cheese (e.g., prema cream cheese or whichever you like) 
 Jello Layer: 
 1 pack Strawberry Jelly Crystals any brand u like 
 2 cups water (or as per packet instructions) 
 Fruit: 
 1 cup of frozen strawberries (e.g., oppo frozen strawberries), thawed and chopped or sliced 
 
 Method 
 
 Prepare the Jello 
 
 Dissolve jelly crystals in hot water according to packet instructions. 
 Pour into a flat dish and refrigerate for 2–3 hours until firm. 
 Cut into cubes once set. 
 
 Cook & Enrich the Custard 
 Mix custard powder with ½ cup cold milk until smooth. 
 In a saucepan, bring the remaining milk to a boil. Stir in stevia/sugar. 
 Gradually whisk in the custard mixture, stirring until thickened. 
 Remove from heat. Beat 2 egg yolks separately, temper with a little warm custard, then whisk back into the pot. 
 While still warm, whisk in cream cheese until fully melted and smooth. 
 Let the custard cool slightly. It should be silky, rich, and slightly tangy. 
 Assemble the Trifle 
 
 In a large glass bowl or 4 dessert glasses: 
 
 Base: Add chunks of Peek Freans Cake Up cupcakes. 
 Fruit: Add thawed strawberries. 
 Custard: Spoon a layer of cream cheese custard. 
 Jello: Add strawberry jelly cubes. 
 Repeat layers until filled. 
 Chill & Serve 
 
 Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving so flavors combine. 
 Garnish with a strawberry slice or a swirl of whipped cream on top. 
 
 Notes 
 The cream cheese in the custard gives a creamy tang, balancing the sweetness of jelly and cake. 
 If you want a lighter texture, fold in a couple of tablespoons of Dairy whipping Cream that has been whipped after the custard has cooled. 
 You can easily swap frozen strawberries with fresh if they’re in season. 
 If you like, mix a little pinch of tartric powder (citric acid) to the jello before cooling to add a sour twist.",2 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1n5suk4/i_make_amazing_food_and_want_to_open_an_expensive/

 Your food looks ok, but nothing I’d pay for, so would suggest sharpening your skills. This should involve making more complicated dishes from scratch: your own doughs, complex sauces from scratch, balancing strong but complementary flavours etc. Challenge yourself, get things wrong, learn, and grow. Take notes, write down your own recipes, and so on. 
 I’ve never met an actually smart, capable person who keeps telling people that they’re smart (implied by polymath and your other self-descriptors). Stop doing this, and if you’re smart, people will see it, and actually respect your intellect. No one likes a blow-hard. 
 If you’re serious about seeking investment, create a business plan. Include your pitch for why someone should part with their money for your specific business. This includes why  you  should have the money, why your vision for a restaurant (one of the most common businesses in the world) is worth paying for, and then why you’re also the right person to be running it.

Reddit,I make amazing food and want to open an expensive restaurant,choozu911,"As you can tell from the other comments as well, the food can be great tasting on its own but it’s the ‘expensive’ part that is irksome. There are so many factors that come into a play in opening a fine dining restaurant let alone a successful one. 
 Expensive can mean different things to different people but let’s say in Lahore, you’re looking at charging, what, 2 to 3 thousand a dish? A couple will be paying five figures for an evening meal at the least. Have you gone to a culinary school? Have you got three or four financial backers. Have you decided on a general direction or theme? Because your pictures are representing three continents and five cuisines.
It’s OK to dream but to have a shot at success we first have to set the parameters to it.

Like what is it that you are looking for especially considering you are a decent home cook (maybe exceptional) but that does not translate to or scream professional chef with a background or contacts to get the right ingredients at the right price. Sorry if it sounds harsh but these are the first things ringing in my mind 
 Also what do you mean by owner? Your job will be to just hire staff, teach them and sit in the back office during day to day operation? That is an interesting approach if you are not the sole investor.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1n5suk4/i_make_amazing_food_and_want_to_open_an_expensive/

This is business, and people seek sure-fire profits, not potentials. The potential crap only happens in movies.

 The restaurant is open 5 days a week and is typically fully booked 3-4 months in advance. There is no set menu. When you arrive at the restaurant, the chef tells you today's menu and you eat whatever he makes that day (unless you have some dietary requirements). 
 He is obviously a great chef and demands the price he wants.

Reddit,I make amazing food and want to open an expensive restaurant,Zaptail,"Most welcome. I already shared the recipe for the brined chicken. Pasting here for anyone who wants! 
 1 teaspoon basil flakes 1 tsp rosemary whole 1 tsp oregano flakes 1 tsp thyme 1 tsp black peppercorns 1 tbsp Lemon juice 1/2 tsp Garlic powder 2 tbsp salt 4 tsp sugar 
 Mixed in 1/2 cup hot water. Then add 1 and 1/2 regular water and 2 thawed chicken breasts to deep bowl. 
 Brine for 2.5 hours completely submerged, outside of fridge 
 Once ready WASH the chicken breasts and put on plate. Then if you want to store put in fridge for later cooking. Or else proceed to next step. 
 Dust the chicken breasts with white pepper powder and salt on both sides well. Put oil in non stick pan. If the pan has lid its great to keep it covered, the steam will help cook it well. 5 mins on each side on medium heat. 
 Btw, I use vatani spices and learned they have the herbs now too. I trust them as a brand and their taste is good, quality matters and flavor does too! Worth investing in yourself.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1n5suk4/i_make_amazing_food_and_want_to_open_an_expensive/

Make a damn restaurant if you want, it makes no difference to us, but get the experience you need to run one successfully so youre not holding your head in your hands a year after you start because youre not getting customers and the bills keep piling up. 
 There's a lot to consider with opening a successful restaurant. Like a proper brand, consistency, brand ambassadors, quality food, a proper running kitchen with a team of cooks and staff to work the reception and wait on tables and clan around and stock the fridges and handle security and finance the place.

Reddit,"Why are Lahoris super lazy? Nobody visits these beautiful parks. Restaurants serving carcinogenic foods are full in the evening. Bad traffic, conjusted markets and empty parks.",holykamina,"There's your answer.  
 Many folks are not financially sound. It's just 20PKR, but it could put a strain on people's financials.  
 Also, i remember back in the early 2000s and 90s, parks were free. In Lahore, near Jinnah FlyOver, there was a huge park that was free. We used to go walk there every day. After 9/11, things changed. The crowd changed. Men would sit in the park and whistle at women. Harass kids if they were playing in the park. People complained to the city, and eventually, they put a guard. Then, they started charging for an entry fee. Then they started charging for the parking. People just stopped coming. Parks that were a bit safer were all under army control, for instance, Polo Ground, and of course, you needed a military ID card/ membership to gain access. Guess what? Civilians didn't get much of a chance to avail themselves of these parks. War on Terror changed many things. It made cities unsafe, and people just started to focus more on food and other things within the safety of their homes. Back in 2005, I remember gyms and sports were very exclusive except for cricket. Everything in Pakistan is exclusive.  
 So I think there is a reason why people are lazy and don't focus on sports much because there are very few affordable opportunities. Let me give you an example. I am living in Canada. There is a huge park near my house (around 1.5 km away). There is no guard, no entry fee, no aunty or uncle harassing kids, and no kid telling other kids, ""Do you know who my father is?"" it's a well maintained soccer field. It has stadium lights that turn on automatically every day without issues. You don't have to beg anyone or pay a bribe to turn them on. There's also a basketball field beside it. It's free and maintained by the city. There's another park 2.5 km away. It has badminton, tennis, and volleyball court. It's free and maintained by the city. Of course, it's a little crowded, but people respect you, and they share the courts with you. In Pakistan, that's not the case. There are no guards or anything.  
 Overall, a safe environment is needed for people to come out. We literally leave our phones and wallets on the side of the court while we play. No one touches our stuff. Also, the city promotes health and wellness every year, which also helps spread awareness. Pakistan does not. Pakistan also lacks the infrastructure where people can bike around to reach their destinations safely. So there are so many factors at play here.  
 I have observed one thing, though. Youth now a days do focus on health. Gym culture is growing, but still, many people are unable to afford.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/156y43f/why_are_lahoris_super_lazy_nobody_visits_these/
Reddit,"Why are Lahoris super lazy? Nobody visits these beautiful parks. Restaurants serving carcinogenic foods are full in the evening. Bad traffic, conjusted markets and empty parks.",Realistic_Pizza4178,"Well, a few things you said are correct but for the most part things are not what you just described. Maybe you haven’t been here for long time. I’m guessing. These parks are quite good actually. Everyone can afford 20 pkr. Race course park is free and very well maintained. These parks have lonely places where anybody would be afraid and thats normal. It’s no longer the same (fear and everything) as you said. I didn’t see ppl harassing kids?! Where did that come from?! Comparing Pak with Canada is like comparing 🍎 with 🍊
I prayed namaz in masjid right besides the jogging track and it was the most peaceful experience I had in ages. You dont get THAT in canada do you?!

Race course is one of the best parks so far. However, not everyone can afford to travel 10 or 15 km to get to a park. Proper city panning is needed. Residential areas incorporating public parks are needed. How are the new DhAs and Bahrias ? Do they incorporate parks in every residential area ? I have been put in Pakistan for 10 years now.

No need to fancy. You're having a midnight snack, not fine dining. Or you can get those local or China-made electric stoves. 
 I dont think there is something you can make with specifications other than noodles. If you still can't get your hands on those, try microwave popcorns (the goated Kernelpops, goes well with DHA vibe). Healthy, flavorful and will keep you full. Enjoyable with a movie. 
 If not, then just get through the night or stock up until the gates are closed. 
 The Korean thing is the Korean thing. They can do it because they have the resources and the other thing is they're cheap af. Here, the same thing is treated as fine dining, just like that Tim Hortons fiasco where people were dressing up in new stylish clothes just to get a damn coffee.

 Then there are carbon filters which are charcol based filters and they filter out VOCs and bad odours which is optional but they are very cheap (600-700Rs) compartively.

Reddit,Make your own Air Purifier,-_-_O,"For those who have air conditioners can use electrostatic air filters and put them on the filters of your split ac. If using cooling or heating try to use higher fan speed as lower fan speed can strain the refrigerant system or better yet just use fan mode when applying the filters.  
 Just google and youtube on how to apply but a general rule of thumb is not completely covering the ac mesh filters as you don’t want to strain your fan motors.  
 As for those who have air coolers and pedestal/wall bracket mounted fans can use the same principle. Take electrostatic filters and cut them to size and put them on your respective devices. Also it doesn’t have to perfect or a sealed system as you don’t strain the motor and the cool winter air keeps them from getting too hot. A tradeoff of a non sealed system is just efficiency is reduced by 20-30 percent which can be offset by increasing the time taken.  
 No need for fancy air purifiers as these electro static filters are just what you need they are thin and can be washed/replaced also are somewhat cheap.

Reddit,What is your daily food cost like? I am spending ~30% of my salary on food every month and can't find a way to cut it/manage it.,AsianImmortal,"I am in Ali Town in a hostel. I have a hotel outside my hostel (there's a couple more hotels down the street too). My hotel usually have daals, vegetables, etc salan for 150 (half a plate) which is more than enough for a person. I ask them to give me worth 100/- salan, and then 2 rottis cost me 30/-. 
 Thats the least I could budget for the few weeks I have been here. But yeah, you might not wanna eat that food for long term. 
 A typical breakfast would either be 100/- for aalu paratha, or 60/- for simple paratha (more if you wanna have omeletwith it) . I'd usually have a simple paratha with raaita if I wanna have an early morning breakfast too. 
 Recently I have cargoed cooked frozen salan made by my mum in lunch boxes (about a weeks worth of boxes, like 2 meals a day) from my city, which probably costed about 300/- to get it moved here ? I put them all in the deep freezer.  
 I can get one heated up for about 20/- to 30/- from a hotel. And then buy rottis and eat them with it. Saves me lots of money on food. 
 Since I just joined my workplace, I found they have a freezer and a microwave there in the cafe. I'm thinking of taking two boxes there. Heating up my morning food in the microwave in the cafe when I arrive for work and then eating up the second meal when I get off work in the Cafe. Saves me the gas/heating up cost.  
 My alternative was to get a gas cylinder and use it to heat up my own food. It'd probably be cheaper than paying 1200/- to 1800/- for heating up two meals a day.  
 I don't know how others do it, but this was my breakdown and calculations so far.  
 Messes (in hotels) here cost about 7000 or more for two meals day.",2 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1fy5ctp/what_is_your_daily_food_cost_like_i_am_spending/

If so, you should always try to eat that unless it’s something you dislike. You could also talk to management about taking some with you for dinner at an additional monthly charge. If not, refer to point 2 and 3 and bring your food with you.  
 How often do you visit home? You could bring frozen food boxes from home on each of your trips. Just defrost, get a chapati and eat.  
 You could try foodpanda weekly homechef subscriptions.  
 Someone here suggested cooking in batches over the weekend. I’m assuming you won’t be able to do that in the hostel? In case I’m wrong, that could be a good option.  
 This is far fetched but, may be try and ask a colleague to get you lunch from home? You could pay them monthly.

Reddit,What is your daily food cost like? I am spending ~30% of my salary on food every month and can't find a way to cut it/manage it.,Dodoloco25,"So the protein intake depends on your body weight and if you are going to the gym. I am overweight and doing gym so it is around 100 (I am trying to do 120-140 soon). You can easily get by on 80 grams as well, in a healthy diet IMO. I suggest reducing the eggs to just 1 dozen and eating approx two a day. (I am eating 4 a day approx right now). I only use 1 spoonful of oil for each dish though. A dish for me is 1kg chicken with sauce (sometimes with eggs) and veggies. So usually it ends up being around 1.5kg of food combined. Help me lose a lot of weight.    
 Also, it doesn't get boring. Sometimes, I will get pasta and pasta sauce to make something different. Sometimes, I get lemons and make a lemon and herb dish. Or get chicken tikka masala and add yogurt to the dish. You can buy ready-made sauces now from different companies at the big stores. We have to eat it ourselves so how bad can it be, I haven't made anything bad (even the people in my office like my food, even if it is sometimes not the best-looking). A lot of cooking at Pakistani houses is literally following the Shan/National recipe and then added more spice/masala to fit the taste of the home. You can do that here (I certainly do).    
 So what helped me cook was getting an electric stove. We can only use cylinders where I currently live. So I basically spent a long time on outside food. Got an electric stove and a pot and a pan with a cover. Now I can just chill and make as much food as I want. And the electric stove doesn't really add a lot of units. I think I used barely 10-15 units a month for it. That is how much an AC takes in a day.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1fy5ctp/what_is_your_daily_food_cost_like_i_am_spending/

 As far as donations are concerned the more you read Quran you will realise that donation/sadqa/charity is going to benefit you the most in hereafter and orphans are specifically mentioned. So its a great decision (namaz and other commands are equally if not more important). 
 I used google maps to search for orphanages. I found quite a few in my vicinity near lake city. I chekced their instagram pages and found quite a few people take layers cakes for childrens birthdays, biryani degh or this that experience and celebrate with kids on different occasions.

 Honestly this area of customer/influencer-based promotion is very tricky because psychologically actual customers in general (regardless what the transaction is, be it restaurant, daraz etc) don't give positive feedbacks. We only become keyboard warriors when things don't go our way. 
 Maybe, since these promotions are incentivized, what you can do is make this incentive available to everyone. I am not sure how applicable this idea is, but essentially your platform can maybe incentivize every reviewer with like a 10% off coupon or something in exchange of the first detailed review (positive or negative) per restaurant to generate unbiased customer reviews.

 I think the current idea you have is decent for continuous flow of reviews, but there should be some incentive that is not bound by a monthly constraint, to tackle those who go out once in a while/month type people. As I personally think the current model is still incentivizing those who go out a lot (3 times a month is still a lot) and may not able to significantly suppress influence culture. Think of it this way: someone puts at least 3 reviews each month will soon come under the limelight of restaurant owners, so they may purposefully make the influencer's experience far better for the review. Maybe if your platform keeps the reviewer identity anonymous, that may potentially overcome this issue. It will lead to another issue of ensuring reviewers are not making multiple accounts to game the whole system, so your platform will need to consider this as well. 
 Pardon my negative approach, please do not get discouraged by my questions. I would very much like to see you do go with some version of your idea that stands out from the other implementations, many of which have shortcomings in one thing or another, especially when it comes to casual people who don't go out often. 
 Also, when you start something, you will get complainers like me 😂, so don't worry too much about it and from every feedback, just filter out what you think are actionable items, if any, and keep them in a to-do list to keep your platform growing.

Goats sacrificed on Eid are perfect and do not have any defect physically or illness.  So, charging extra for them is justifiable. Secondly, people who can afford, should do as much as they can so no needy people should be left out and people who cannot should not worry about it and should try to save money, may be they can do after skipping one. It is only fardh for people that can afford it.

Reddit,What is wrong with people?,GenZia,"Never heard of Brim Burger.  
 Explain. 
 
 After this, he started to yell at every single staff member. 
 
 There are two types of anger: Explosive and implosive.  
 When people with explosive anger feel wronged, they yell their t.i.t.s off and eventually cool down after letting off enough steam. 
 It's generally moronic to confront a man going through the motions of a classic explosive outburst. 
 Just leave him be, let him have his moment, and be glad he didn't have an implosive outburst.  
 When people with implosive anger implode (as opposed to explode), they quietly walk away, come back with a gun, and shoot up the place!  
 Okay, it's a bit of a hyperbole and gross exaggeration, but you get the idea.  
 
 I just wish more people would understand how difficult it is to manage large back to back orders and be polite to the kitchen and front office staff.

Reddit,Lahore hostel life,Apart-Flamingo9688,"Bro, JT ka scene yeh hai ke har area same nahi hota but one thing I can tell u for sure:  Johar Town literally runs on these neighborhoods jahan ek central plaza hota hai nearby . Thoda sa door bhi ho sakta hai, like 10 min walk, but trust me it’s worth it. Bas ek dafa locate kar lo us plaza ko aur life sorted hai. 
 In plazas u’ll find everything. Kiryanay/grocery sai le kar darzi, electricians, tailors, basically day-to-day ka sara setup. Food ka masla bhi wahi solve ho jata hai. Either u eat from where ur relatives are getting it ya phir tandoor sai roti le lo and grab salan from stalls. Bohat stalls hotay hain jahan gharon ke log side hustle mai khana bana ke bech rahay hotay hain, like a proper “traditional kitchen” vibe. On top of that, shawarma stands, dahi bhlay, and random snack stalls bhi mil jatay hain. Bas quality check kar lena, kuch log hygienic hain aur kuch log... bro, bas dekh ke rona aa jata hai 😂. I’ve lived in three different parts of JT and trust me these plazas within walking distance are the  biggest advantage of living here  in JT.  
 Now about travel. Younger lot (like u and me) mostly rely on  Indrive/Yango  and tbh it’s pretty common and safe to use here. I’m guessing you're a guy and have come from a smaller city(no judgement/discrimination, just working with the info to help you out) so this is pretty safe in lahore and for short distances, as well as before evening or night and a comman thing. 
 Idk exactly where ur campus/house is but on average bike-Yango ka fare mujay 300–400 parhta tha from college to home (total). So best is to just download the app and check how much it’ll cost for ur route, then calculate monthly travel kharcha accordingly. Van services ka option bhi hota hai lekin agar Yango/Indrive ka fare reasonable aa raha hai toh go with that. Kyunki it gives u versatility and in A-levels u never know kab early chutti mil jaye or kab late night kaam ho jaye.

How is weather in Lahore? I’ve heard that u sweat constantly even indoor unless u have AC and I can’t imagine being out there on the road under the scorching sun 🌞  
 And i am not very social,introvert at all times. I wanna change it. 
 Would u recommend that i attend events? Like nearby events of music or cultural festivals happening in universities like PU and other? And mind u that i have never been to such big cities before—would i be risking it?

Reddit,Lahore hostel life,Apart-Flamingo9688,"No problem janab, hum hazir. 
 Anyways yaar, for weather, I’d say it’s something very subjective honestly. Factually toh it went up to 48°C last summer, but personally speaking, u get used to it when you’re outside doing chores. Sunscreen is a must. Don’t try to thug it out, rang rung sai mtlb ni, I’m saying this from a skin health perspective. Air pollution and sun do a lot of damage, so aik lotion-based sunscreen lailana (I’d recommend Nexus SPF 50, skin absorbs it easy and it doesn’t leave patches, can be found at most pharmacies). 
 Shuru mai hell lagega zara cuz dhoop cir par prti hai, but lahoris have adapted in their own way. The city comes alive after 6pm, after magrib till like 5–6am. Before that, whoever u see out is there because of work and because they don’t have a choice. It’ll be a change cuz the city never really goes quiet. Subha kaam aur raat ko shugal lgta idher basically. So yes, it’ll be hot, won’t sugarcoat that. It’ll take you some time to adapt, and only get out of your house jab zaroorat ho.
As for indoors, bhai 2 cheezain: kamray mai ventilation rkho aur atleast air cooler if you can’t afford AC. Mazak kai ilawa, cooler sai zyada kamra thanda rehta and try to have a room downstairs away from sun cuz concrete poora din sunlight trap krta. The only downside of cooler is July kai baad jab it rains and humidity is too much, us time run it without water just for ventilation and you’ll be good. Desi cooler decent size ka costs not more than 10–15k rupees, way cheaper than an AC and lighter on the bills. 
 As for events, brother aap A-levels college jaa rhay ho. Idher events, concerts, qawalian, MUNs, parties (halal pizza wali bhai 😂) among so much more is always happening, literally at least one if not more are always happening. Other schools also send their event invitations to your school or post on their social media, and u can go to their events too, like concerts, qawalian, sportsfests. Bohat shor aur raunaq hoti hai.
That said, abhi college mai honay walay events par dhyaan kro prhai kai saath. Kyun? Cuz you’re new to the city. Thora adapt and familiarise krlo with the mahol because trust me kafi difference hai. Mai bhi originally lahori hi hun, and having said that, zra raston ka pta chalay ga, logon kai rawaiyay aur attitude ka, temperament ka. You’ll also figure out konsa event worth janay wala hai aur konsa ni. Konsi university kis standard kai log attract karti hai (stay away from PU kai events, personal advice hai, logon ka maiyaar acha ni). And u’ll make friends too jin kai saath enjoy karega. 
 Besides, sab sai important, use the first couple of months to make a foundation and discipline for A-levels studies in college. Toh sirf college kai achay achay events enjoy kro.

Reddit,Secret Food Spots,hiphipaway,"1) Definitely go to Amu — if your preferences are more white linen fine dining make a reservation for dinner; if not their brunch is excellent too. 
 2) Gaijin — you’ve mentioned you’ve already been to Japanese places, but Gaijin is a definite standout in an increasingly crowded Japanese cuisine space in Lahore. They’ve gone with an Izakaya theme as opposed to a “non-defined all of Japan’ thing we have here at the moment. 
 3) Sunny Kitchen — as above re: your mentioning of Thai food but I generally really dislike the Thai cuisine one gets at all these Pan-Asian places in Lahore where a green curry may as well just be roadside Manchurian just made in prepackaged (and overused) green curry paste jar. Sunny Kitchen’s food is what I know Thai food to be when it’s done right, so I overwhelmingly endorse it. 
 4) Kai — Japanese / Peruvian fusion [not really fusion since a lot of Peruvian food is influenced by the large Japanese diaspora there]. It’s definitely different from the general fare, but you seem to be someone who revels in the act of discovery so you may find that Kai ticks all your boxes. 
 5) For The Table — think gastropub but without the pub. Elevated and really thoughtful versions of the kind of food one would generally dismiss as now standard across all these “we serve burgers, pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, and a ton of deep fried stuff!” — which they do too but it’s actually done really well. Their blackened chicken tacos were great the last time I went — but also to be fair it’s been two years since I went there last and don’t have a gauge on how they are now.

Subway is also less likely to make you sick. Well known international chains like McDonalds and Pizza Hut won’t make you sick either but of course those aren’t healthy options.

You can easily fall into the 'hypocritical business idea' category if marketing is not done ethically and your performance marketing is very invasive. So please be cautious. 
 Other than that there can never be enough loyalty programs in any given market and it is one of those run for short time and make money and exit ideas in low-touch economies. So if you have the answers above, go for it.

Reddit,Charging 1 rupee on card transactions,AlternativeCry9184,"I’ll try to explain it in simple terms, when we do an online transaction like on restaurant and shopping stores there are many forms of transaction authentication used by that store or restaurant like there’s a system called  1-Link  which I believe you already had heard or seen on debit cards and ATM machines 
 It’s a platform by private entity to make online bank to bank transfers possible which was not possible before State Bank of Pakistan had not invented or invested in such technology to begin with so that platform makes VISA and MasterCard transactions possible and Meezan bank to any other bank transactions possible so in return they charge a small amount of fee something like 0.30 rupees  
 Similarly platform like VISA and MasterCard which is a private platform which enables make debit or credit cards possible to make international and national transactions easier and yes they do charge something like 0.25 rupees per transaction  
 And lastly there’re two more entities banks and government which also do charge taxes and charges so after all that kinda messed up system paying Rs.1 is okay cause those stores and restaurants also have to pay other charges too which they won’t charge for customers as they’re caused by only due to online transactions",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1mxe35d/charging_1_rupee_on_card_transactions/

 Unrestricted access to warm water, ability to afford branded deodorant and perfume, being able to go to barbershops regularly, being able to afford new clothes and shoes instead of having to buy second-hand. Having curated garbage collection points and civil organisations that keep the cities clean.  
 Compare all that to so many people of Pakistan that are so poor that they are forced to live in tiny closet sized rooms in dirty slums with 8-10 people per room, sharing a bathroom with limited access to warm water and having to wear yesterday's rank clothes cuz they only own a few pairs.

Reddit,Starting my own interior design business. How do I go about it?,Admirable-Bath-3244,"This may totally fail, but the most value-for-money method I can think of is this:  
 
 Set up a killer digital brand (behance, portfolio, 3D videos yada yada) 
 Create sick pamphlets (1 pager). Good quality gloss paper, with some pics, good content (hire a good copywriter) 
 Go out and distribute/post these pamphlets to under-construction buildings that might be cafes, etc. Also, collect the owner's phone number and call them. Hire someone if you're scared of calling strangers. It pays. 
 
 Or, give a 20% or so referral fee to contractors. Partner with them. 
 This is all based on the assumption that your clients get their cafes/restaurants constructed themselves rather than rent and redo the interior. If they rent, then partner with property dealers. They'll connect you with your prospective clients. Give them hefty referrals.

Reddit,So I made a Lahore inspired artwork,Ronald_Arif,"Rang Mahal School, Lahore!   
 Rang Mahal School, officially known as Government Rang Mahal High School, formerly known as Rang Mahal Mission School, is a government school located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. 
 History 
 Rang Mahal School was founded by Charles William Forman and John Newton on 19 December 1849 as Lahore Mission School. It was the first English-medium school in northern India at the time of its establishment. Initially, the classes of the school were started under a tree with three students of Kashmiri ancestry. The school was later shifted to Rang Mahal in 1852, a mahal that was previously owned by Saadullah Khan, a grand wazir of Emperor Shah Jahan, but was acquired by the mission to establish a school. 
 The school was nationalized by the Government of Pakistan in 1972. Formerly, it was under the administration of Presbyterian Education Trust.

There can be multiple reasons behind this, 
 1- We (restaurant) don't issue single orders in peek houres as there's always a shortage (we call it stacking, it saves ur time and rider charges) and we don't want to close the app or cancel the orders. So rather than no getting the delivery at all, it takes more than usual time during busy hours. 
 2- During relaxed hours its totally upto riders, as they must be already low oj rides so they wait few more minutes to bundle up the deliveries.

Reddit,[ Removed by Reddit ],Get-Help-Or-Die,"I didn't do it, but I can see how someone was pushed to that limit. Constant noise blasting in your ears for hours can make you anxious, stressed and enraged. The bottle should've been thrown on the manager that we all keep calling and he doesn't listen. And the police that we keep begging, but does nothing. Read my other replies. I always went with the legal routes of calling the manager and the police. But believe me, 100s of calls later, they did NOTHING. When there's no law, then don't blame the one who's rights are being shamelessly violated for taking the law in their own hands. 
 I can sympathize with the lady, but when you get into a profession, you should know the legal limits too. Just because you're poor, you don't get the right to rip everyone's sole with loud blasting qawalis. I am also a middle class person, so if I throw something, that should also be justified as ""I have a desi family with old parents and family to feed"". Or I should also start doing illegal stuff in my own field and give the same excuse. 
 And you can't just ask us all to thicken our walls? Are you even serious? Instead of the rogue restaurants merely turning their dials down, you say this? ALL neighbors should now do this? Commercial areas also have some limits on the decibels of noise, according to my research. Their threshold is a bit higher, but when they're bordering residential areas, they can not disturb the neighbors. I have not only done my research, but also talked to lawyer in this regard.

Monal at bhera will be on the opposite side (lhr to isb) but you can climb across a pedestrian bridge and go there if you want a proper restaurant experience). 
 With the current humidity and sunlight, plan evening excursions. Perhaps a tour of old lahore using the lahore sightseeing bus can be done ending with dinner at food street opposite badshahi masjid. Its managed by TDCP you can book it online or on call and it covers important historic parts of lahore with a tour guide. If you want to shell out some more money go for rangeela rikshaw tour it covers most of the old city. 
 Go to Anarkali if you want to do shopping etc. beware pickpockets. If youre the mall type go to dolmen mall but be prepared for lonnnnggggg walks.  
 You can also visit lahore museum and quaid e azam library if youre into that type of stuff. 
 Wagah border is another must visit (reach there at 3pm and take lots of water because the sunlight and humidity are killing these days). Not recommended with elders or small kids.

 You need to call your bank and confirm if the payments were received by merchant or if they're still in the system. If they confirm as received, you need to call bank helpline while you're in the restaurant and get them to talk to the restaurant manager and settle it right there.

There was a long queue in drive through so they had one guy near the counter who was collecting debit card from the customers to speed up the process 👀 major red flag as I have never seen it happening any where. Anyways, I handed over my card (MCB Islamic debit card) but didn’t let him out of sight. 
 When we get to the counter, our payment was still not done. They were just stacking up cards at the counter. Again, not sure which genius at the branch floated the idea. They asked my name and picked my card. Swiped it and said that it’s not processing. I handed over a foreign bank’s credit card with global transactions enabled on it and the transaction went through. 
 After an hour or so, received message from the MCBIB as well that the amount was deducted from the debit card. Since they charged two separate cards, bank won’t reverse it and I would have to raise the complaint, which would take 45-60 days to resolve so I let it go. 
 Always ask the restaurant to print the transaction record slip if they say that transaction has been rejected. I used to do that but due to time constraints and crowded drive through, I had to leave.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1moqkub/financial_frauds_in_restaurants_of_lahore/

It's a known issue, it can happen, and things are sorted out within a month or less. It has happened to me at a retailer and money was credited back within 30 days.

Reddit,How would you drive more sales to a Local Fast Food Restaurant in Lahore,Fearless-Pen-7851,"1- Pay a vlogger who does food reviews or just in general  videos for one on your restaurant  
 2- Organize some small competition event with a registration fee and give a prize to the winner while keeping a margin from the registration fees collected  
 OR Special offer for gathering events such as birthdays, meetups, etc 
 3- Offer packages for corporate offices nearby and charge monthly 
 4- Now the most important. Have a good attitude with customers, please, for the love of god. The reason i say this is because the moment someone's small business gets a lot of customers, they stop caring about the feedback from them.  
 5- Take individual feedback from customers. Some will say good some bad. Don't take it personally. Ask what you can do better next time. 
 6- Watch out for regular customers, give them special discounts or that new dish you're trying to start but don't know if customers will like it and ask for feedback  
 7- In the age of people working online. I have yet to come across a place in lahore except coworking places that lets me sit there and work in peace for a few hours in the evening or night without registration or monthly fees that doesn't cost a leg and a kidney for a coffee or pastry. Use linkedin and other social media platforms for this, and you'll attract a lot of young people willing to pay good for your services.

Reddit,"American traveling to Lahore, Pakistan for a wedding – what should I know?",Calm-Needleworker-89,"So number 1 thing is Lahore is very hot, plan accordingly. Its basically like Arizona in summers lol. Not v humid but hot. You should dress accordingly, light clothes. You can wear shorts etc that wont be a problem. 
Security wise its the same as any big American city, some areas especially at night would be unsafe, but only in robbery sense. Guns are not a common problem here so you dont need to worry in that sense. 
People are the nicest, if you step out alone too you wouldnt have any problem.
Most people will understand english but will be hesitant to speak or are not fluent enough to speak.

Reddit,"American traveling to Lahore, Pakistan for a wedding – what should I know?",Necessary_Low_6669,"I'm an overseas Pakistani who visited Lahore recently for the first time in 30 years with my spouse who is not of Pakistani or South Asian heritage. I wrote about my trip in detail here, which you can read here. To answer your questions, I would strongly encourage you to go but I would also strongly encourage you to be extremely careful, especially if you haven't traveled to a big city in a developing country like Cairo, Nairobi, or Mumbai. 
 Lahore is a heart-achingly beautiful place with a lot of history and a lot of culture. Not many people get to see this and Pakistanis know this. There's a strong culture of hospitality, but even a stronger desire to break the isolation the country has been experiencing over the last 20 years that's been easing recently. Most people will fall over themselves to be good hosts. 
 If both you and your wife are not Pakistani origin nor of South Asian heritage, you'll probably not want to be outside of your hotel without a local. Plenty of people do visit Lahore on their own, but I imagine that they're quite well-traveled in other places. 
 Ultimately, it's safe, but things can turn on a dime. For example, I was in Lahore for a week and on the last day, there were massive protests that led to a lot of major roads in the city being closed with a massive security presence. Major tourist sites, hotels and even shopping malls have metal detectors and armed guards checking cars for bomb, so in that sense I wouldn't worry about going to major tourist sites, but I would also have a mindset that prioritizes safety. 
 In terms of accommodations, you'll want to stay in a five-star hotel with its own security perimeter if you want to feel safe. This is a relatively short list: Pearl Continental, Avari, Nishat and maybe a few others. Assuming you and your wife don't have any family in Lahore, your wife's friend might offer you a place to stay. I'll let you decide how comfortable you feel doing that, but personally I'd stay in a place like the Pearl Continental, which is where international cricket teams stay in Lahore. 
 You realistically can't go anywhere in Lahore by yourself due to the amount of chaos on the streets. I felt like 500 metres was the furthest I could walk, even in the nicest parts of town. There are very few crosswalks or traffic lights in Lahore. You will absolutely need to have a car and driver take you anywhere. Uber doesn't work in Pakistan anymore, there are a few rideshare apps. 
 In terms of health, drinking only bottled water goes without saying, but if you eat at the nicest restaurants in the city, you should be fine. We didn't have any issues eating at high-end places in Gulberg, DHA, five-star hotels and malls like Emporium or Packages Mall. Air quality shouldn't be as bad in April, but it's an issue year-round in Lahore. I would also bear in mind that it would be extremely hot, as April and May are the hottest parts of the year, hot enough that sometimes birds fall out of the sky.",2 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1oymw8y/american_traveling_to_lahore_pakistan_for_a/

Reddit,2023 and restaurants and businesses are still not accepting card payments,polochakar,"I work in IT and web development and worked with business for online and card payment systems. 
 Poor policy making by State Bank. On one hand they encourage digital payments but charge 1% on every transaction, the rest is charged by bank issuing the card. All of this is out of customers pockets. Can get to upto 7% in some cases. 
 Don't know why but I feel anyone who has been to a few countries, none of them charged customers for using cards. 
 Banks are often given free hand by SBP and most security lapses and withholding customer and business payments by banks should be illegal. I have a friend who owns a cafe in Australia and his brother has a restaurant in Lahore. In Australia he gets online access to bank and payments are transferred daily to his account. In Pakistan it takes minimum 48 hours but sometimes it's withheld for longer with shitty customer service to resolve issues. 
 Pakistani banking system is very complicated and not friendly to either customer or business. Deductions like WHT, filer/non filer issue are not seen in most countries. 
 Businesses are not given much incentives. Account opening by businesses and issuance of cards and machines is still a complicated process and if I own a business it's a headache and not a business incentive. 
 Tax fraud is a huge factor, Pakistani businesses operate two books. One is for tax office and other is for themselves. All card transactions are on tax books so they tend to discourage using it. 
 Zakat and Islamic issue. A huge chunk of population considers Interest and banking as Haraam and don't use it. Zakat should be personal and not a Jaga tax by govt that people believe will be used in corruption rather than helping others.",6 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/12judth/2023_and_restaurants_and_businesses_are_still_not/
Reddit,2023 and restaurants and businesses are still not accepting card payments,gullfounder,"As a business man ( running Pharmacys ) we dont encourage card payments because of following reasons. 
 1) we have to charge 2.5% extra on each transaction which has to come out of customers pocket. Which of course they dont like. 2.5% is set by banks not us. Out of which 1% is taken by state bank of Pakistan him self. So yeah gov policy... 
 2) it takes more then 48 hours to get that payment into bank and bank dont give online access to such accounts and thus they only way to take out payment is go to bank with cash chequu and its huge pain in the ass to get in line to get our money back. 
 3) while some businesses do avoid it due to tax but most dont want the hassle of going through tedious paper work involves in getting those pos machine. It usually takes 6 to 8 month to get one pos machine that if you have connections in bank... 
 4) outdate machine broke very often and banks ask us to pay for repairs our self. Not easy to find repair man for those. We even have to pay for paper rolls which they chargw shit ton more then what they are sold in market...

 You have an NTN andand you’re a payer, sure, but do you really pay the exact tax due? Do you declare each and every sale on the exact amount? I highly doubt that.

For the last two years, I have stopped even stepping into Fortress. Joyland is already a confined area, and now it is just packed beyond comfort. Even the outdoor grass areas are overflowing. 
 It is not about judging anyone, but the crowd has completely changed. People who cared about basic manners and decency do not come here anymore. What is left is chaos. There is no line system, people push and shove, and you constantly feel uncomfortable. The school trips are completely unregulated. We saw lines of students behaving so badly that we had to convince our kids not to enter. 
 The main issue is that there are no other clean, decent options for families with kids. Places like Racecourse Park and Jinnah Park do not have such attractions and close early, and malls close early or are not affordable for many. So people from nearby dense inner-city areas and older residential localities treat Fortress as their only outing spot. Which is understandable, but the mismanagement ruins it for everyone.

Reddit,What are the knife laws in Lahore?,alimaqsood95,"Yaar 😞 I'm sorry you even have to ask this. Undoubtedly we have failed. Allah SWT hum sab ko mehfooz rakhain. 
 Consider pepper spray please and (I think) you can keep it in your purse for good (no problems with security checkpoints). It's genuinely effective.  
 Somebody bothering you? Pull it out and bam, one spray and a kick between their legs (which is basically useless because their eyes will be burning but that's for your own satisfaction). 
 Also, consider keeping a knife holder so you won't have to worry about keeping your purse with you. If the need comes, throw away your purse, pull out the knife and chop chop them like tamatar pyaaz. 
 Lastly, if you have made the courageous decision to defend yourself, all this is in vain if you don't practice. Practice pull out. Practice swing with force. Educate yourself about some non-fatal and easy access body targets to tikka boti. 
 Baaki, the biggest weapon, always always recite:
1. Dua e safr
2. Ayat ul kursi 
 when leaving your home (if you're a person of faith). Amma taught me this and Allhamdulillah I can't begin to explain how many situations I have gotten out of, without a scratch.  
 Legit lastly, practice patience as well. Don't pull a knife out in harmless arguments. You might get yourself in unwanted trouble. Only use it when you're feeling unsafe. And don't wield to threaten please because you risk giving them the knife if they are fast and swift.

Reddit,What are the knife laws in Lahore?,hashtaq2,"Unless you are trained well with years of experience in a solid fighting style like Silaat, Muay Thai, etc, carrying a knife, especially a krambit, won't help. In fact, it can become even more dangerous. 
 Krambit requires very specific techniques to be effective which are a part of Silaat because that is where krambit was born. Without those techniques, a krambit won't work, or won't have the required effect. 
 In the turn of events, you won't be able to do damage but intimidate the a burglar or a pair of them to shoot you which, in worst case scenario, can end you in your grave. 
 Snatchers and burglars usually come with a gun or two. Nowadays, they are using backup pairs as well. So while a pair of them engages you, another is behind for backup in case you try something smart. 
 Besides, haven't you heard the phrase, ""never bring a knife to a gun fight""? Don't be a fool. Self defense is a community effort, not an individual effort. You would have to be extremely lucky to get away trying to be a hero. 
 Self defense starts from self awareness. You find yourself in a place you don't feel comfortable, get out without pulling much attention to yourself. 
 Wear a bullet proof vest if you intend fight in a scenario like this and then pray they don't ""aim for the head"" before engaging.",3 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/15wxa21/what_are_the_knife_laws_in_lahore/

 It is also a secure area, electricity goes for a total of 1 hour at a fixed time. Half an hour in the afternoon and the same at 8pm.  
 It’s also like its own city, anything you want to shop or eat is available.  
 Sector A bahria town is a pretty quiet comfortable space where 1 kanal houses start at 5 crore. Look into that. (Good ones go for 6+ though) 
 The only con is that it’s far away from major places in lahore and electricity is expensive (10-20 percent higher than competition.)

I'm in this position because my father worked all his life and took a lot of risks to bring my family to the US and gave us a strong work ethic. I have been working nonstop since I was 17 years old.  
 After a year of being jobless, you don't need a remote job, you need a job. Any job. I've worked at gas stations, cell phone stores, delivered pizza, acted as a helper in a hospital, driven a taxi, led soldiers in combat and used all of that knowledge and experience to get a decent office job and then worked really hard to grow that into a career. I only finished high school and don't have a degree or any big certifications.  
 You need to go out there and work. No job is too small and you can't just sit around waiting to have something like my situation fall into your lap without putting in years of work.  
 I just spent two months in Pakistan and saw many cases of successful people working really hard to earn a good living and I saw just as many cases of guys waiting for a naukri that befits their status. You need to stop thinking about ""log kya kahenge"" and just start working, no matter how small. Use your education. The guy who installed my UPS easily clears 1.5 million a month and that's only because he can understand English language instructions and knows how to navigate settings menus to provide consistent and stable connections to people. And I found him because he's the only one with even a basic online presence in Gujranwala.  
 Learn a craft, build a basic online presence, actually respond to phone calls, and provide decent service and you can grow that into a successful business. You don't need to spend millions on a physical storefront anymore.  
 For decades, every wedding in my family was filmed by Karachi Studio, a big videographer with a shop on GT Road. My sister just got married and it was filmed by some guys she found on Instagram. There's no shop or anything. They do everything online and charge more than Karachi Studio. Learning to use a camera isn't hard and building an online presence isn't hard either but educated guys don't do it because they consider it beneath their stature and education level.

 Just try not to pray in jamaat. Or if a jamaat is going on, pray on your alone in the most secluded spot you can find and ideally finish before jamaat ends.

Having said that, I wouldn't risk it for a wedding. Simply not worth it.

Reddit,Very pleasant experience in Lahore on my first day,crispyfade,"I'm also an Indian origin person and hindu. Have many pakistani friends and have been to your city, and enjoyed myself greatly. Needless to say, Im often telling my Indian friends and family that Pakistan is way more nuanced than they realise, there's great diversity of culture and thought like any other country. That you can't take a caricature of the worst people and characterize all of society. In the same vein, I think many of the voices on this sub would benefit from a nuanced take on India. Consider that there are people who  want  you to see only the rabid online trolls and confirm pre-existing biases. In India, I live among and socialize with muslims on a daily basis. I interact with kashmiris in my city as well, many who are open about their desire for independence, and open about their resentments. Some are more amenable to the status quo. These opinions are casually shared, it's not some kind of truth bomb. Nor is the human cost of holding onto the dissident ""hindu"" populations of other regions. Consider whether you actually think you live next to a billion people seething with hatred for you and your religion, or if you are just seeing what's basically a psyop for very online people to reinforce their confirmation biases and manufacture consent for a conflict. The tsunami of vile online trolling targeting muslims isn't reflected in most of the dedicated RSS/ hindutva people I know. I'm a no filter kind of person who also has friends in that camp, they aren't the ones creating this online hostility.

Reddit,Car in 4.5 million,zaid_brilliant,"I'm surprised, no one has mentioned Changan Alsvin so far. You can get an almost brand-new Alsvin Lumiere (Top of the line trim) under 4.2m. 
 I'm driving one for the last 3 years. Have over 71k on the odometer. It's the best ""bang for the buck"" car in its category.  
 In the price, what you are getting with Alsvin Lumiere is, cruise control, sunroof, adjustable projector headlamps, TPMS (Tire pressure monitoring system), ECO Idle, and drive-by-wire steering (you can drive with your left pinky, it's that soft). Soft steering is the first thing my friends notice when they drive my car. 
 It's quite reliable as well. Took it to Kalam, Kashmir, and Astoor with 4-5 people onboard in the last 3 years. No problem so far. 
 The only downside is its paint quality. Its paint layer is quite thin as compared to other cars in its category. So you can't have PPF on it. It's not that bad either.  
 Its suspension is b/w City and Yaris in softness. Its ground clearance is also b/w City and Yaris. 
 The best thing about it is its mileage. On long routes, I easily get 16-17 on 110-120 km/h. If you do 80-100 you'll be 18-19 as well. In the city, it is about 13-15, depending on your driving style.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1ej4l5v/car_in_45_million/

Reddit,[ Removed by Reddit ],amirzyn,"If you're planning to visit explore Pakistan As a solo female traveler, it's essential to prioritize your safety and make informed decisions. some tips to help you have a smooth and enjoyable trip. 
 
 Accommodation: Both hotels and Airbnb can be safe options, but it's important to choose reputable establishments with good reviews. Look for accommodations that have security measures in place, such as CCTV cameras, secure entrances, and 24-hour front desk services. Read the reviews from other female travelers to get an idea of their experiences. 
 Dress code: While there isn't a strict dress code for female travelers in Pak it's advisable to dress modestly and respect the local culture. Wearing Pakistani clothes or opting for loose-fitting, conservative attire like long shirts or kurtas with pants or skirts would be appreciated. Carrying a lightweight scarf or dupatta to cover your head in religious places is also a sign of respect. 
 Safety helpline: National emergency helpline number, 15, that you can call in case of any emergency or if you feel unsafe. It's always a good idea to have this number saved on your phone and be aware of your surroundings. Additionally, it can be helpful to stay in touch with local contacts or family members who can provide assistance if needed. 
 Traveling to interior Sindh and KPK: Like any other region, there may be some areas with specific security concerns. It's recommended to check the latest travel advisories and consult with locals or reliable sources to get updated information about the specific areas you plan to visit. Taking necessary precautions such as traveling during daylight hours, avoiding isolated areas, and using reliable transportation services can contribute to your safety. 
 Political situation: It's crucial to stay informed about the political situation. Pakistan generally welcomes tourists, and the major cities you mentioned (Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi) are considered relatively safe for travelers. Additionally, Gilgit Baltistan is known for being one of the safest and worth visiting areas in Pakistan, offering stunning natural beauty and a rich cultural experience. 
 
 Keynote: it's important to trust your instincts, stay alert, and practice common-sense safety measures while traveling. Interacting with locals and immersing yourself in the beauty of Gilgit Baltistan and other parts of Pakistan will make your trip truly memorable.

Reddit,[ Removed by Reddit ],TinyLittleFlame,"You SHOULD visit Pakistan, but caution is a must. Here my recommendations: 
 
 Interior Sindh is unfortunately an absolute no go, especially for a Solo Female, unless you’re the niece of a feudal lord who can send his personal army to escort you.  
 You may want to avoid the urban centers, at least initially, because they are harder to traverse alone and you’d likely stick out as a sore thumb. But as a starting point, you should land in Islamabad (relatively the safest and most used to foreigners) and book one of the international chain hotels or a reputable guest house in a lively area,  perhaps the ones around Centauras mall.  
 Next, I’d recommend doing a bit of research on tour groups. As summer vacations have arrived most of our youth will be going on organised group tours to Northern Pakistan (an absolute must see). Find a reputable one that starts their journey from Islamabad and book with them. This way you’ll be travelling as part of a group and the organisers will be in charge of dealing with the locals, doing all the arrangements and ensuring safety and comfort.  
 Plus, once you manage to make some friends in the tour group, you can ask their help in showing you around town when you come back to Islamabad.

 Not all men are like this. I agree. But we don't know which ones.  
 For years, women have been complaining about safety issues in public areas. Men of our society failed to take action against that. And now that action is being taken against them, they don't like it.

 They shouldn't have taken your order.

We're well dressed, btw as in casual but decent looking.  
 So we went, and out of nowhere, a security guard cane and stoped us, saying we're not allowed to enter because only 'families' are allowed. I felt so embarrassed in front of my brother and then took him somewhere else. We even tried explaining we're not here to do any freaky stuff and that we're brothers and that he's a guest. But no, we're not a 'family' if there's no women with us. 
 I hate to say this, but a few pakistani men have ruined the lives of all of us, other men and women in Pakistan, and abroad as well.

Reddit,Honeymoon Advice,No_Needleworker7844,"My take on honeymoon trip: 
 
 Don't travel in group with random people. These tour operators don't care whether you are newly married or not. They treat everyone equally. In my opinion, newly wed couple should have some time relax to their mind. Usually in such trips, they are always in hurry as they have to follow a timetable strictly. Couples should focus more on spending time with each other instead of spending time in traveling. 
 Lahore to hunza in 5 days is tiring i think. You are traveling most of the time. 
 I would recommend you to fly to skardu spend 5 days their. (If budget is not a problem) 
 2 people trip to skardu with air ticket included is around 130k max. If flying from isb. 
 Again, these tours are best for people who want to discover more places in leas time. So it is more like quantity over quality. For honeymoon, i would prefer spending 5 days at one place thn traveling to 10 different places in 5 days. 
 
 For budget friendly trip, i would recommend you yo spend time in shogran and siri paye. At least 2 days in shogran and you can travel to naran from there.",9 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/10i9alr/honeymoon_advice/

 Here are my suggestions: 
1. Do you have a lawn at your place? You could start by spending a little time there on your prayer mat in the sun. 
2. Try the masjid again and this time don’t bother with what the aunties are thinking. Perhaps go at Fajr, there probably won’t be any aunties at that time. Go a little earlier so you can also offer tahajjud and then listen to the Fajr azaan from inside the mosque, it’s a beautiful thing to experience.

Reddit,Beach bags,Nerd-Explorer,"I see you are travelling to Thailand. I have been there, and IMO you can find it very easily in Thailand. I did a lot of shopping in Thailand. A bag like this will cost you around 100-200 baht so that's almost under 1500 PKR. So don't waste your time finding it in Lahore. 
 Some of the markets where you can find it very easily in Bangkok   
 Chatuchak Weekend Market: 
Good for gifts/souvenirs and bags like this, very diverse market, you can find anything here.   
 Pratunam Market: 
Wholesale market for clothes, you can find shorts/swimsuits/other clothing here very easily. I went with my wife & we had a lot of trouble finding good swimsuits in Pakistan but here in Pratunam we bought it under 200 baht each thing. 
 Train Night Market: 
Good for random stuff like clothes, shoes, belts, purses etc...

It’s hard to explain, best experienced 😆, although a lot of western countries lack this as well. 
 Don’t think so. But unfortunately with Pakistan’s lack of communication and access to information, it’s hard to say until you are at the border. It’s very very unlikely though. Won’t have issues as an American, as a recent visitor to India, they may try to make up lame rules though.

Only a couple of things that you need to make sure along with having a valid visa. You should already have a taxi waiting for you on Pakistani side to take you to city and places! As border is almost 15kms from Lahore city! So book a taxi for entire day.
Also try to be the first one to cross the border in the morning! Check with Indian side and confirm when does the crossing open.
As far as you concerns about safety and other are! Don’t worry you’ll be fine!

 I am thankful for your interest in our country!!! I have a few cousins and friends that are american and they have visited Pakistan many times.  
 To answer your questions:  
 1, yes its safe to travel, you might find people staring a lot but Thats because they dont see a lot of white (USA / UK/CAD) person in that specific area.  
 2, I dont think vaccination would be compulsory, but I can always double check to make, if you want?  
 3, there are a lot of different laws but in our country, we are super cool with White people. Just make sure not to carry/drink any kind of hard drinks during your visit in Pakistan.  
 4, yes going back would be hassle as the boarders open for a specific time frame. You can always get an AirBnB(with super host) or a hotel (please dont get a cheap one) for an overnight stay. 
[if you want any help will that, I am happy to assist] 
 As for what you wear, its not compulsory that you wear super conservative clothe. You can wear Jeans as well, but the clothes will help as less people will stare 🤷🏻‍♂️

 Lahore has a balance of heritage and modern facilities. I don't think you need to worry about it. 
 
 If you want to get a visa, plan a longer trip because it would be a useless experience. 
 The majority of women in Pakistan don't even wear headgears themselves. No problem with what you're wearing but making sure showing lesser skin means getting less pervy (harmless) looks.

Reddit,Would buying a 150CC bike solve my problem (Honda/Suzuki),MrAnonPlaysalot,"For open roads, Honda CB150F and Suzuki are both perfect. Even a Suzuki GD110 is good. My main reminder would be to buy these bikes for comfort rather than speed. Don't take these bikes in heavily populated/traffic area as these bikes are heavy, and you can get tired more easily than if you were driving a lightweight bike like CD 70 or CG 125. GS150 is also an option in 150cc category of bikes. It's also smooth, but its design is on the older side. 
 I, myself, use a CB 150F and I travel about 50 Km total per day, and it has served me nicely. Its maintenance isn't that much, and fuel consumption is lovely too. For reference, consume can make it through 5 days on 1500 PKR worth of fuel (May need to use reserve on last day at the end). CB 150F does consume a bit more engine oil than other bikes. It's not that much but would recommend keeping an eye on it. 
 CB150F: Parts are easily available, and aren't expensive. Wider than GR150. 
 GR150: Parts are available usually at dealerships only and can cost more, but overall, it's a nice bike. Great as a family bike too, and is not as wide as CB150F. 
 Would recommend giving the used market a try, as the prices for these new isn't worth it. At the 600k mark, I saw Gixers so used for 150cc bikes is the sweet spot.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1jbvk2k/would_buying_a_150cc_bike_solve_my_problem/

 Buying a bigger bike won't solve your problem. Buy some kind of seat cushion for some comfort and speed moderately.

Reddit,Would buying a 150CC bike solve my problem (Honda/Suzuki),deathshadow8111,"Here are the solutions you can try. 
 
 First make sure air pressure sahi hai. Second Check your tire's treads ky worn out to nahi Hain. Check tyre manufacturing date old tires can also puncture a lot even tho they are not worn out much. If they are relatively new but still getting punctures then they could be fake. Lastly the road you travel on has too many nails nothing we can do about that  . I can recommend a tire list if you want. 
 Idk how Honda 125 is costing you 12k a month in just maintenance. It could be you bought a used bike in a bad condition or probably didn't check it. But now that you have spent 50k on it. I think it should be smooth sailing from here. Remember that 150cc parts, maintenance, labor is all expensive then 125, also the fuel avg is worse.  
 
 3.please don't become a random article in some newspapers because of over speeding you have a family waiting for you at home and a job who will replace you In days. they don't care.  Let's say you are riding at 90km/h on 125 that gives us 26 min to job now let's say you ride 120km/h on 150 that gives you 20. I don't think 6 mins early to work is worth gambling your life for . 
 
 The slipping feeling could be because of worn out tires. Tires profile (they are lean) or because of how you break. if you while holding the clutch the tires slip. 
 
 Lastly should you get a 150cc? Yes if you have the budget to buy a new bike. Reasons 
 
 Low maintenance on a new bike for a year or 2. 
 Less vibration then 125 
 Better comfort 
 Better breaks

Reddit,Would buying a 150CC bike solve my problem (Honda/Suzuki),Emergency_Anxiety967,"Hey if the tubes get punctured without anything (nail, screw) going into the tyre and tearing it apart
The problem is either in tour your rims (get em painted from any workshop, painted on the inside)
Or tyres themselves (they might have worn down and need replacement) 
 My tyres would automatically puncture for no reason because it was worn out (i used to do burnouts) 
 Secondly comfort is subjective. People say ybr/gs150 is smooth, definitely is but i love riding bikes, so i have a lot of tolerance, i can do 300kms on a single sitting on my cg125. I like the feeling of it, makes me feel more connected to the road, comparatively ybr/gs150 in my experience is like sitting on a cloud, pretty smooth, the seat is better too, suspension is better too. 
But in my personal experience if im going down a road 100+ and its obv Pakistan lol the roads dip, randomly become sorta wavy, the roads aren't flat yk, i just feel more confident on the cg cuz it sticks to the road more when it comes to higher speed.

Reddit,"Pet owners in lahore, need review and advice",Da_BrownNoob,"20k for spaying is absurd... who is charging these rates??? 
 I wouldn't say he's rude.. a good guy and well knowledgeable in his field. Its just that he's moved away from performing surgeries and takes more of an advisory stand.  
 He started doing the same with me which is why i left (my cat has a detailed history of a few problems which i took a good enough time explaining to the 2 main veterinarian's at that time [Waleed & Abeer], so him recommending me to other assistants blindly and not showing up at the clinic was a concern for my cats health with any procedure i went for). Similarly, I started seeing a hike in complications (surgery & test results) on google reviews and a few visitors having arguments with the staff often. 
 If ur confident that he's right for ur cat and would be doing the procedure/following it closely then i say go for it. 
 Otherwise I'd recommend Abeer Pets (clinic is just after EME should be Dr Abeer), use to work in Waleed Pets. He charges 10k for spaying if i correctly remember (with free 4-5days follow up medications).  
 Similarly, as u mentioned ur cat was anemic so u would obviously have to go for CBC & PVC tests well before surgery (should be 700rs -1000rs each) and make sure diet as well as weight is maintained properly. 
 Not sure too but deworming (make sure no parasites) and core vaccinations (rabies & feline distemper) would be also required atleast 3-4weeks before spaying due to ur cats case. Should get a vets opinion on this. That would cost an additional 3,500rs. 
 Another option i would recommend is Zia Vet (Johar Town should be Dr Ehtisham), would perform the surgery in the similar price with proper guidance.

Go to old Lahore, the walled city. It's the people, real people one should interact with. Fancy places, who cares. There are plenty in Australia as well as USA. 
Go to Anarkali, eat at the local eateries. Go to Lakhshami Chowk. Go to places to eat chicken karahi. 
Visit Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur. It's near Lahore.

Reddit,Things to do in Lahore? Crossing from Wagah Border,NotYourGolChappati,"Haha. I wish I could be of help there. I have family in Lahore so whenever I visit, I stay with them. The only time I have stayed in a hotel was in Pearl Continental and it was honestly just okay. I have heard good things about Hotel Nishat though so that might be worth checking out. I know you can find a bunch of airbnbs too but I would be a little wary of those.  
 For traveling, uber works perfectly well. Uber in Pakistan does allow you to pay via cash and most drivers prefer that so just keep that in mind. Otherwise, you can find plenty of rickshaws wherever you go. You could rent a car but unless you have experience driving in India or Pakistan, I wouldn't because the traffic is absolutely insane. Some parts of Lahore actually have a metro train which is pretty efficient and surprisingly very clean at least till when I last went to Lahore.  
 In terms of touristy places, really depends on what you are looking for. There are those hidden little historical gems literally everywhere in the core city. Badshahi mosque and Lahore Fort are kind of the big attractions though so might be worth checking out. Right next to them is the Food Street where you can find pretty decent food with a view of the old city. Fun fact, that is coincidentally also where Lahore's historic red light district is. Wazir Khan Mosque and Shalamar Gardens are also famous tourist attractions.  
 Anarkali Bazar is an old market and fun to explore. Right across from it, there is a museum. It is small but I used to really like it as a kid. Liberty Market is a bit newer and a decent place if you are looking to shop. Same goes for fortress square mall though liberty is significantly larger. If you are really looking for adventure, try Ichra market. If you want proper malls, there is Emporium, Packages, Mall of Lahore and a few in DHA. M.M.Alam road also has most of the designers' outlets.  
 In terms of food, just be verrryyyy careful with water - last time I visited, I brought back some infection that had public health department in Canada all ruffled up, all because I was stupid enough to try a lemon soda from a roadside vendor. If you have your travel vaccinations, it might not be as big of an issue but I would still avoid anything that has water that hasn't been boiled/cooked.  
 On the topic of food, M.M. Alam road is pretty famous for food but most of those are fancy places with tasteless food IMO. Following are some of the things that are on my list for when I next go to Pakistan.  
 
 Nadeem's Buffet in Faisal Town. They do a mostly mutton spread which is really good.  
 There is a place called 5 Star Naan Shop of Ferozput Road. I LOVE their ground beef Naan.  
 This one is probably hardest to find - Chacha Fish Corner in Misri Shah for their fried fish.  
 Bundu Khan (it is a chain) has this thing called Puri Paratha that goes really well with their Maghaz Masala (that's brain FYI)  
 If you like Afghani food, I believe Truck Adda is pretty famous - to be fair I haven't been but my husband swears by it.  
 I also used to love the breakfast at Lakshmi Chowk - my favorite is maghaz but people generally really enjoy paye too (paye is trotters FYI) 
 Takka Tak at Kaka at Lakshmi Chowk (it includes something called kapooray which is testicles but you can always ask them to not put any in your order)

I recommend that because it requires much less moving around. If not malls, then you can go to MM Alam or Y Block to find those stores in nearby places. If you want to go a little fancy, then you can check out Gulberg Galleria. Again, I do recommend Dolmen Mall over these options. Liberty is nice, but it has mainly unstitched stuff and you don’t have the time to get stuff stitched. I don’t think a lot of winter stuff has launched yet in stores, so not sure how much luck you’ll get from that 
 Travel - would recommend getting a driver with a car than use InDrive. I use it regularly, but I know the roads and can keep my eye on the routes that drivers use.

Avari and PC are both old school luxurious hotels located in the old city (beautiful mall road) very close to the historical sites. But the traffic is quite bad during rush hours and they are far from downtown (gulberg). 
Rooms are a bit old but well maintained. Avaris food is top notch. Their local and japanese restaurant are the best ones in town. The gym is just okay. 
 Nishat gulberg is a modern hotel (much recent than both PC and Avari) and is located in the heart of the city. You can access shopping malls, cafes and restaurants easily and the rooms are more modern. The gym and pool are nicer too.

 Shalamar Bagh is boring. Just a garden, nothing special in it. 
 Old lahore is beautiful but too hot at day times. Walled city lahore authority arranges some night time guided visits. Do check their Facebook page. Otherwise go early in morning. Breakfast or dinner in the foodstreet beside badshahi mosque will be good experience. Do visit Masjid Wazir Khan and Shahi Hammam, along with the adjoining market, again in morning. 
 Museum is good to visit during day time. Its a really nice place to visit, not too crowded, spread over vast area and has loads of historical stuff. 
 Zoo is okay if you like animals but open only during hot day time. Keep a cold water bottle and preferably an umbrella with you. It does have some trees to provide shade in some places. 
 Go to lakshmi chowk (nishat cafe, butt karahi, sheefa qeema or kaka takatak) late at night for traditional Lahore food. 
 Eat halwa poori or naan channay. Many small restaurants all over the city. You will easily find a popular one near wherever you stay. Go to Capry or Bundu Khan in liberty if you are staying in Gulberg.

Everything is really affordable, chaye and hath ki bani hui coffee both taste great and cost around 150-200 only. It’s accessible by orange train and you can sit for as long as you want. It’s never overcrowded, never any creepy guys or even if they were they don’t bother you. Mostly undergrad and postgrad university students are there from PU, GCU, NCA, KE i.e. all the surrounding universities and colleges. They have a selection of books and sometimes events like recitals e.t.c. Pretty much a place you can go to every day.  
  However since I have moved very far away from the Mall Road area I can’t travel there everyday as I don’t have my own transport. If you’re new to lahore you should check it out. They don’t have sockets and wifi though so it’s not ideal for that kind of work plus the interior is kinda shabby because it’s an old place but still feels cozy, especially the upstairs portion.

 I think it depends on where you go though; if you're visiting someplace spiritual or anything similar, it'll be frowned upon.  
 It might be frowned upon if you're visiting someplace with frequent co-settings, but I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem in upbeat cafes and places like that.

 Image youre there to go to xyz city, you arrive at the bus stand where somebody will ask you if you want to go to xyz city standing in front of the bus so you would assume he is a conductor or something, you negotiate the ticket price and he gives you a small discount and asks you to go and sit inside the bus. At the time of departure, you will be asked to show your ticket which you don't have and then it will hit you.  
 You eat out at any restaurant nearby and at the time of the bill, you will be charged from 1000 Rs to 5000 Rs for a plate of biryani. You will lose not only money but also your health over the next few days. That dhaba/stall pays 5000 to 10000 rent per day and people pay that price because they make 3-5x more by trapping the outsiders. (local police are in on it.) 
 You just arrived there from another city and the rickshaw will charge you 500 for a 1 km ride but will take a couple of u-turns so you don't understand that you were overcharged.

Reddit,Need Honest Reviews for Class 7 & Class 4 Schools Near Askari 10 (Lahore),Remarkable_Date1637,"I wouldn't recommend LGS P5 for anyone below A level classes based on my experiences during my O Levels, A Levels, and while attending UOL University. One major issue is the high teacher turnover; teachers frequently leave mid-semester for elementary and middle school, and students often have 2-3 different teachers handling all subjects, many of whom lack proper qualifications. Additionally, the school has a tendency to repeatedly ask for money for various events, only to cancel them and occasionally forget to refund parents. The focus of the school seems to be more on extracting money from parents rather than providing a quality education or extracurricular activities. Bullying is another significant concern; students often face bullying, which goes unnoticed by teachers until parents intervene, and even then, the response is often dismissive. While the fees are somewhat reasonable, starting at around 40,000 and increasing as students progress through the grades, the experience leaves much to be desired. Moreover, there is noticeable favoritism among teachers towards certain students, which can create an unhealthy environment. Overall, I believe there are better options available for younger students seeking a supportive and effective learning atmosphere.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1kykzt2/need_honest_reviews_for_class_7_class_4_schools/

Reddit,Need Honest Reviews for Class 7 & Class 4 Schools Near Askari 10 (Lahore),PalpitationNo8819,"Great insights, You've highlighted some strong benefits of the IB curriculum, especially its focus on critical thinking and university preparation. While I agree IB can be an excellent pathway, I have a couple of concerns based on parent feedback in Lahore that I'd love clarity on:   
 
 Teacher Qualifications: I've heard from several parents that not all IB schools in Pakistan especially in Lahore have teachers fully trained or certified to deliver the IB curriculum effectively. Some struggle with the pedagogy shift from rote learning to inquiry-based methods. Can you confirm if this is still a widespread issue? I'm happy to be corrected!   
 Assignment Support & Workload: A recurring theme among parents is that schools sometimes don’t provide enough structured support for major IB assignments (like the Extended Essay, Internal Assessments, or TOK essays). What i think is the IB’s emphasis on self-directed learning can backfire if schools lack robust mentorship systems. For instance, students may receive broad guidelines but minimal feedback on drafts, leaving them overwhelmed by research, citations, and academic writing skills they’re still developing. As one parent put it: ""It feels like the school expects the student to teach themselves IB-level work."" 
 
 Would love to hear if LGS International/Learning Alliance (or others) actively bridge these gaps through workshops, 1:1 supervision, or writing centers. Thanks for sharing experiences!",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1kykzt2/need_honest_reviews_for_class_7_class_4_schools/

While I hated going to school a decade and a half later.
A few things I would say is they while sports wasn't a focal point that school did very well in hiring good faculty and providing excellent Extra curriculum for children to learn and gain experience from.
Another school I would recommend checking out is ISL( International School Lahore)it's founding members are some of my ex teachers from LGS and one of whom is an absolute gem of a person and great teacher, and as far I've heard he's doing an excellent job at spreading his core values in the curriculum his students study.

You’ve addressed things most people ignore—like staff vigilance, mental health support, and the real culture of a school.   
 A few quick follow ups if you don’t mind: 
 
 Homework Balance: You mentioned pre-O-Level workloads are light. Do teachers at least emphasize conceptual understanding over rote learning? (Trying to gauge if ""less homework"" means thoughtful teaching or just lower standards.)   
 For My Son (Class 7): Since you can’t speak to boys’ schools directly—any reputable schools you’ve heard good things about for boys? Especially ones strong in building work ethic?

Reddit,Need Honest Reviews for Class 7 & Class 4 Schools Near Askari 10 (Lahore),PositionFar4662,"They definitely have good teachers who emphasis on conceptual understanding, in science subjects especially i found the kids there to have more grasp on core concepts and participate more in class, as compared to my previous schools. When i came in 9th grade they were ahead of me in science subjects in terms of understanding etc but a con of this system was that they suddenly struggled in urdu, pak studies and islamiat type of subjects as they suddenly had a load of material to prepare and could not easily manage it for exam prep, plus though the teachers were amazing, i could tell that the urdu faculty was weak as most of the class was, on the same level as a 4-5th grade matric student in urdu. But i dont think these three subjects are as big of a deal as i have seen most o levels students from alot of schools struggle with them in 9th grade but then get used to the preparation method in 10th grade. Oh and one thing i like about this school is that they have anonymous surveys at the end of every term where you rate each teacher and suggest what they can improve, plus whenever we have gone to coordinators to complain regarding teachers and get them changed, we have been heard and been successful (this was a big advantage for me because in my previous schools despite multiple efforts teachers were almost never changed and you were stuck with the same teacher and your learning was ruined). 
 For boys schools, i would not suggest aitchison as its education has deteriorated and their environment is generally bad, alot of entitlement, and chaos there.  
 Beaconhouse Defence Campus- i have heard good things about it and they have especially good faculty for extracurricular and debates, i have found their kids well groomed and smart whenever met them in competitions 
 Lgs JT is probably the most famous school for boys. I do know that their studies are very focused and rigorous so in terms of work ethic its probably great. But i am always skeptical about larger schools as unless there is great administration, it is a hellhole with only few kids getting good grades to keep the school's standard high. As when i went to DPS (very famous around the area and has ten sections for each class) i too went hearing the great work ethic and studies they had, but due to bad administration and so so many students there was nobody there to check if teachers were actually teaching, this led to alot of bad teaching, rude teachers behaviours, and bad student environment as often times there was bullying but went unnoticed as nobody cared, leading to teachers only focusing on making us rote learn and overburdening us with work which did end up with good report cards if your humiliated into studying but overall is not something you want your child to be in) so for large schools i would advise you to go yourself, actually see classes and the administrative structure, coordinators, headmistresses etc and not just see the good grades they give out. 
 The City School Ravi - is also a good school i have heard of.

Reddit,Best place to eat in late nights in Lahore,Fluffy_Eggplant7514,"Sorry to comment in here reddit bot is not approving my post 
Hi everyone, 
 I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice from those with good driving experience. I have a budget of 3 million PKR and I’m looking to buy my first car. The thing is, I don’t know how to drive yet, and I don’t live in a gated society where parking might be easier. 
 Here’s where I’m torn: 
 Some friends suggest I buy a used Cultus within the 10-12 lakh range, use it for a few months to learn driving, and then sell it to upgrade to my dream car. 
 Others recommend getting a Vitz for around 2.5 million. 
 Another suggestion is to buy the newer model of Cultus for around 1.8 million, use it for a few months, and then sell it to upgrade to my dream car. 
 Ultimately, I really want a Honda Civic Rebirth, as it’s my favorite car. But I have a gut feeling that if I spend 10-12 lakh on a car now, I might end up using the remaining budget on other things and not be able to afford the Civic later. On top of that, I’m worried the price of the Civic might increase if I wait too long. 
 Now I’m confused. I’m confident that driving a car won’t be a big deal for me, as I already ride a motorbike. I plan to buy an automatic car, so I think it won’t be too difficult. I intend to take driving classes and drive carefully for a few months. However, I’m concerned about what if driving a car is not as easy as I’m imagining. 
 To complicate things, I’m getting married this year. I’m worried that if I buy a cheaper car to learn driving and then have my wedding, I might not have any money left to buy the Civic or another sedan later. I don’t think it’s worth it to buy an Alto or Cultus in the 2.5-3 million price range. 
 Also, I’d appreciate some suggestions on the best car to buy within my 3 million budget. Should I spend all my money and get a car now? What are your thoughts on the maintenance costs of the Civic Rebirth compared to other cars? Is it high? What’s the fuel mileage like, and how does it compare to other options? 
 so Should I go for the cheaper option now and save up for the Civic later? Or should I just take the plunge and buy the Civic now? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

 There's good enough security, for starters. Practically nil street crime.  
 No problem of gas, water, and electricity.  
 Property rents are reasonable, at least compared to on-going real-estate prices.  
 The town doesn't look like a ghetto and is 'reasonably' clean nowadays, though that's subject to change (celebrities and elites have moved on decades ago). 
 Quick access to hospitals (both private and govt. i.e Sheikh Zaid), schools, colleges, and Punjab University is practically 5 minutes away. 
 A McDonald's and KFC branch on the main boulevard, if you're into imported crap food (no judgement). 
 Someone already mentioned Gulshan Park, if you feel like 'hanging out.'

 Now lemme start by saying most of the activities I've referred were done by friends and family, I personally haven't done some of these. 
 There's a lot of hype about Playdium in DHA. You should check it out. 
 Last I heard, Joyland had gotten pretty boring, so it's up to you if you want to visit. 
 There are a couple of laser tag places. I personally haven't tried them, but my fiance has. You can look up on maps for that. 
 There's also 2-3 padel sports spots. It's a good activity for evenings. 
 If you're looking to explore mosques and historic place, then there's always spots like Badshahi mosque, Hinar Minar etc (though that's a small travel). 
 You can also reach out to farmhouses to see if they offer horse riding. 
 There's a bounce spot in Lake City. You can also visit Lake City Mall to watch a movie. If you're actually hoping to see a movie, I'd recommend Cue. 
 If you're in cue, you can try out boba tea from tattle tea house. 
 MM Alam,  Emporium and Packages Mall. 
 The Army Museum is an interesting visit. They have a few displays with realistic sound effects, so you can ask for that too.

 I believe that they are alive, and that Allah loves them. That for me is automatically a good thing. You make it sound like they should be avoided.

Reddit,What is the best pizza place in Lahore?,ZaimGamer,"There are a variety of places you can have decent pizza.
1. 14th Street Pizza - Relatively Economical, lots of branches. Most of the flavors are decent
2. NY212 - Economical as well. Most of the flavors I had were just alright, although thin crust with beef pepperoni (my preferred topping) was quite good
3. Pizza Max - Hit or Miss on flavors. Although they have the best thin crust Beef Pepperoni Pizza I've ever had so far
4. The Cheese Factor - it's known more for their deep dish pizza. Best flavors are Peri Peri and Garlic and Herb
5. Papa John's - Quite Expensive, but the flavors are good imo.
6. Broadway - used to be pretty great, but their pizza sauce along with the rest of their pizzas, they've fallen off pretty badly in terms of quality. I'd ask you to avoid them if you can lol
7. Pizza Hut - pretty much dead at this point. The last branch I ever saw was in Fortress Stadium. Don't know if they still exist
8. Forks n Knives - they're more of your Desi styled pizzas. They have decent taste in my opinion.

 You can easily get a local job as a content writer, making upwards of 50k a month. Companies especially  love  candidates with an OL background, so you'll have absolutely no problem standing out. And if you can follow research instructions and  produce even remotely coherent writing, you're ahead of 60% of people working these jobs (believe me I'm not exaggerating, the space is flooded with poor writers and there's more than enough work to go around, even after the recent advancements in AI) 
 Competition for remote positions is tough because there are thousands of applicants from all over the country, so your application might not even get viewed. Or they might prefer someone with experience. If you  can  work in-house, theres tons of work in Lahore. 
 If you decide to go this route, you can DM me if you need any help. (* I'm 22F, I did writing for 2 years during my undergraduate for fairly similar reasons, also promoted to editor) 
 Sidenote: Call centers are incredibly low-pay for how exhausting they are. I don't know how a student could manage it unless you're truly desperate. Writing positions usually have a cap on how much work you're expected to produce (2500 to 3000) words a day.

Reddit,Was my experience in Pakistan a once off unique experience or is this the norm?,Worried_Depth8916,"In Pakistan they overcharge you and try to make money from every possible way. 
 I have been recently getting my motorcycle fixed (my dad used to do it before). In 1 month I ended up spending over 20K on it (on a cheap 2003 model which probably does not value more than 50K). 
 I have had a number of incidents where the fixed motorcycle part stopped working right after I left the mechanic's shop. When I started going to a wholesale shop for parts, then I came to know that the same parts local neighborhood mechanic used to charge me for exactly double the rate. 
 Even at the wholesale professional shop, where they also had repairmen, I spent over 14K on it, a chunk of which was for lights, indicators, bulb, and horn. They said that they would rewire everything and make sure everything is perfect. (These things used to only randomly work before). 
 1 week later the horn and indicators were again only randomly working, and not working when I needed them.  
 Every time this happens, when I get a mechanic to fix an other part (like the horn), he would somehow find other parts broken with the bike and say if you don't repair it it won't work or it would break apart. Like 2-3 weeks ago I got new brakes, when the mechanic opened my bike for horn/lights stuff he said you should also get new brake shoe. I told him no. For horn/light/indicators I have legit had to go to SOO many shops because none of them did their work well. 
 This is one. 
 Another incident I face a lot is in mobile electronics like charger, datacable, handsfree.

This confusion arises from the fact that Saraikis have not had an independent state since Ranjit Singh’s invasion, which led to the Saraiki belt being completely submerged into Punjab. While you could give an exemption to the Bahawalpur state, it too was forcefully integrated into Punjab. Saraikis are culturally a mix of Sindhi and Punjabi influences, but we have a strong history of being separate from the cultural center of Punjab, which is Lahore. In fact, for a large portion of our history, we were part of Sindh as well. The only reason people assume Saraikis are Punjabis is because Punjab controls the southern Saraiki belt, even though our language is also very similar to Sindhi, but no one calls us Sindhi. Saraikis prefer to be recognized as a separate group, but many Punjabi nationalists argue otherwise. Their opinion, however, does not matter, as we have been declared a separate group on the Pakistan census, and we are the fourth-largest group in Pakistan overall.

Reddit,I have some hate for everyone,DarkEvader,"Your intense loathing for the city seems misplaced, likely stemming from personal grievances about industrialization rather than an objective assessment of Lahore itself. Let’s not pretend urban expansion is unique to Lahore. Metropolises inevitably attract people, and unless you’d prefer turning existing neighbourhoods into slums, accommodating growth in housing, infrastructure, and traffic is a necessity, not a plague. 
 I recently attended the Lahore by Night tour in the Walled City, where I saw firsthand how the city’s beauty captivates outsiders. Among the group were 12-15 foreign tourists, visibly in awe of the architecture. One of the guides mentioned that foreign tourism in Old Lahore (Mughal, Sikh, Colonial areas, etc.) has surged in recent years. He now gets about 10 foreign visitors daily in winter and spring. Two things they consistently highlight: (1) how clean and green Lahore is compared to Delhi and much of India, and (2) how well-preserved and diverse its historical architecture remains. 
 Lahore is one of the most historically, culturally, and politically significant cities in South Asia, having served as a pivotal seat of power for successive empires. It is a living museum of architectural wonders, each structure bearing the imprint of the rulers who built it, forming a rich and layered historical tapestry. Considering South Asian cultural attitudes and ongoing economic challenges, the WCLA does a commendable job preserving this heritage (have a look at their insta). 
 One American tourist I spoke to had taken a drive down Mall Road earlier that day. He told me he was utterly fascinated by Lahore’s history and beauty, even saying I was lucky to have such a rich cultural heritage. The problem isn’t with Lahore itself but that many of us have become desensitized to its beauty, while others remain too parochial, letting personal biases cloud their perception. All things considered, Lahore is objectively a beautiful city that struggles with industrialisation and urbanisation, as does most of South Asia.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ix9cjz/i_have_some_hate_for_everyone/

Most of the money earned from southern Punjab is siphoned off to Lahore, let me ask you one thing what exactly is it that Lahore contributes economically? 
 In US every state contributes something to the economy and spends what it earn on its own. What exactly does Lahore produce or contribute.  
 Most of the high value factory is in Sialkot, gujrat, faisalabad. Most of the high value fruit farming is in multan. The financial center of Pakistan is in Karachi. The sea port is in Karachi and gwadar. The minerals are in Baluchistan and KPK. WHAT DOES NORTHERN PUNJAB CONTRIBUTE TO PAKISTANI ECONOMY?  
 Normal countries do not behave this way. For India Mumbai and Bangalore are the most important cities and get the most amount of budget because it contributes the most to the economy. Why does Lahore and Islamabad get more budget than it contributes? 
 The true answer is this weird centralization of Pakistani power and politics in north central punjab which has contributed to a lot of our ills. Read about this topic, I am not saying that one individual or his ethnic background is at its fault, it’s the system and our system is designed to pull the money from contributing state and spend it on Islamabad and Lahore which contribute nothing economically.",-1 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ix9cjz/i_have_some_hate_for_everyone/
Reddit,I have some hate for everyone,DarkEvader,"You’re oversimplifying how economies function. First, no major city in the world generates wealth solely from local industrial production. Cities like Lahore, Islamabad, and even Washington D.C. thrive on services, governance, finance, and trade rather than factories or ports. By your logic, London contributes ‘nothing’ because the UK’s industrial output comes from the Midlands and North. In fact, most of Karachi’s wealth also comes from trade and shipment of industrial output produced mostly in other cities and provinces. That’s not how economic value is measured.  
 Lahore is Pakistan’s second-largest economic hub, contributing through services, finance, IT, education, retail, and real estate. It has the highest per capita income in Punjab and is home to major financial institutions, IT parks, and multinational corporate offices. It’s also a cultural and media center, generating billions through related activities and events. The city provides a massive consumer market that drives demand for industries based in Faisalabad, Sialkot, and Multan. Without Lahore’s commercial activity, those industries would have fewer buyers. 
 As for Southern Punjab, yes, there’s a historical imbalance in fund allocation, but that’s due to governance failures, not Lahore ‘siphoning’ money. Development funds are based on political influence, population density, and administrative priorities, not just raw economic output. Even in the U.S., taxes from wealthier states (California, New York) often fund less prosperous states. The idea that every region should spend only what it earns is unrealistic in any centralized state. This would lead to catastrophic economic disparities between regions, which would engender regional resentment, fuelling separatist sentiments and further destabilising the country. I am happy to delineate on how exactly this would unravel, if you’re interested.  
 The problem isn’t Lahore or Islamabad; it’s a nationwide governance failure that affects multiple regions. Trying to frame it as ‘Northern Punjab hoarding wealth’ is a lazy, divisive narrative that ignores the larger structural issues in Pakistan’s economy.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ix9cjz/i_have_some_hate_for_everyone/
Reddit,I have some hate for everyone,Ok_Enthusiasm4124,"Sorry but a lot of what you said is not true. Pakistan needs extreme decentralization, most successful economies work in decentralized structure where the money they make through property taxes and other forms is then used to fund infrastructure, schools. This is exactly how China and US works. The only reason we don’t practice this is because it hurts certain strata of people who contribute less but consume more aka northern Punjabis. 
 Do you know which state in US has the cheapest petrol it is Texas since it produces the most oil. On the other hand our coal plant was built in sargodha while most of our coal reserves are in Thatta sindh, when asked shehbaz sharif plainly replied I wish to benefit my people. This is the sad state of affairs. So don’t try to whitewash the deliberate mismanagement under the carpet of so called ‘economy doesn’t work that way’. This is precisely how it works. Missispy and Ohio and rest of the rust belt are poor because they don’t contribute much, New York is the finance capital of USA just like Karachi yet we can see how New York is one of the most well developed state and Karachi is one of the poorest. Karachi last year contributed more than 30% of the gdp yet got less than 3% of the spending budget. This is not how economies work. 
 Yes there is some money that goes to center but the majority of the money goes to city mayor, administration and provinces. The federal money is used for emergency situations like forest fires, education, military, subsidies. I understand a portion of the taxes going there but the difference ain’t small. The industrial capital and most productive city of Punjab is Sialkot and faisalabad yet they get the much less spending budget than Lahore.

 Which part, exactly? The bulk of my comment was addressing your claim that Lahore contributes “nothing” economically, which is patently false. Lahore is the second-largest contributor to Pakistan’s economy after Karachi. Faisalabad and Sialkot may lead in industrial production, but their overall economic contribution does not come close to Lahore’s, because, again, industrial output alone is no longer the defining measure of a city’s economic strength. 
 Why are you so fixated on industrial output? Modern cities worldwide have shifted from manufacturing to services-based economies. Do you resent Lahore for keeping up with the rest of the world? Do you believe, for some unexplained reason, that industrial output should take precedence over economic output from services, finance, and trade? The reality is Lahore contributes more to Pakistan’s economy than any of the industrial hubs you mentioned because it has evolved to meet the needs of its 13 million people. Its economy is a blend of services and industry.  
 So the real question becomes: why shouldn’t Lahore receive the largest share of Punjab’s budget when it contributes the most to it? If you advocate for extreme decentralization, are you prepared for Lahore to keep all of its revenue while cities like Sialkot, Gujrat, and Faisalabad are left with only what they generate? Because that’s how decentralization works. 
 Yes, Karachi’s economic potential is being wasted due to poor governance, but this is a provincial failure, not a federal funding issue. Karachi is not a federal territory (if it were, it would have turned out more like Islamabad). The federal government cannot override Sindh’s corrupt leadership and take over Karachi’s administration. If it tried, PPP and MQM would call for mass protests and civil unrest. Karachi’s undoing isn’t Lahore, Punjab, or centralization—it’s the PPP-MQM nexus that has enabled corruption, mismanagement, and crime. 
 And what exactly does any of this have to do with Lahore or Punjab? Are we stopping Sindh’s government from governing itself properly? If anything, Punjab is the biggest loser in federal funding. It contributes the most to Pakistan’s GDP but receives the lowest per capita federal funding. If decentralization happened, Punjab would benefit the most—yet I still oppose it because I know it would leave entire regions in even worse economic conditions. 
 Have you considered what happens to KPK and Balochistan under extreme decentralization? They aren’t productive enough to sustain themselves at current standards. Their security, public utilities, food supply, and basic services depend on federal redistribution. If you take away federal funding, these provinces will slide further into unrest and economic collapse. 
 At some point, you need to stop blaming Lahore and start recognizing the real problem: provincial mismanagement and governance failures. 
 Moreover, your argument for decentralisation is built on half-truths and cherry-picked comparisons that don’t hold up under scrutiny. Pakistan does not need “extreme decentralization” in the way you describe because most successful economies—including the U.S. and China—are not as decentralized as you claim. 
 The U.S. does allow states to control a large portion of their tax revenue, but the federal government still redistributes funds to poorer states through federal grants and social programs. States like Mississippi, West Virginia, and Kentucky receive more in federal aid than they contribute, while California and New York are net donors. This is exactly what happens in Pakistan: Punjab (the highest GDP contributor) receives the least per capita funding, while Balochistan and KPK, which contribute the least, receive the highest. Just like Mississippi and Ohio, Balochistan and KPK are poor despite receiving more federal funding than other states. Karachi (a city) is the financial capital but is underdeveloped because of corruption and poor governance. Sindh receives more per capita federal funding than Punjab; how it chooses to allocate those funds is a provincial decision, not a federal one (decentralisation at play). Your criticism seems to be directed at local governance failures rather than federal funding or centralization. 
 Your China comparison is outright false. China’s economy is heavily centralized, with the central government controlling taxation, land, and industrial planning. The money China’s provinces generate is not simply kept at the local level—it is pooled by Beijing and reallocated based on national priorities. If China were as decentralized as you claim, poorer provinces like Guizhou and Yunnan would have collapsed while cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen would hoard all the revenue. That is not how China works. 
 Your claim about cheap fuel in Texas vs. Pakistan’s coal plant in Sargodha is a perfect example of your misunderstanding. Texas has cheap fuel because of its deregulated oil industry, not just because it produces oil. Meanwhile, energy infrastructure in Pakistan is based on grid connectivity, logistics, and demand and not just proximity to raw materials. Sargodha is closer to central Punjab’s industrial hubs, making it a more strategic location for coal power distribution. Besides, Pakistan’s largest coal plant (Thar Coal) is in Sindh, so your argument is self-defeating. 
 As for Karachi vs. Lahore spending, you’re mixing up tax contributions with GDP share. Karachi’s GDP is driven by trade and financial services, but most of its taxes (sales tax, customs duties, corporate tax) go to the federal government, not the Sindh government or Karachi’s mayor. This is why Karachi’s infrastructure suffers—not because Lahore is “stealing” funds, but because Karachi’s local governance is dysfunctional, and Sindh’s government has failed to invest in its own economic hub. If Karachi had a competent mayor with greater fiscal autonomy, its revenue could be better utilized, but that’s a governance issue, not a Lahore vs. Karachi issue.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ix9cjz/i_have_some_hate_for_everyone/

Reddit,I have some hate for everyone,DarkEvader,"I forgot to address some of your specific points, so here’s a follow-up. 
 
 In the US, every state contributes something to the economy and spends what it earns on its own. 
 
 This is factually incorrect. Only 13 U.S. states contribute more to the federal government than they receive in federal funding. The majority are net recipients, meaning they get more federal funding than they pay in taxes—most of it coming from ‘richer’ states like California and New York. This is standard practice globally. Governments redistribute resources to ensure economic balance and prevent underdeveloped regions from lagging so far behind that they become economically or politically unstable. 
 
 What exactly does Lahore produce or contribute? 
 
 This is the laziest refrain in your comment, and frankly, it’s absurd given we all have Google. Asking what the second-largest economy in Pakistan contributes is beyond unserious. Lahore has a GDP of $84 billion (PPP), driven by a dominant services sector (finance, banking, real estate, IT, retail, education, healthcare, tourism, media, entertainment) and a diverse industrial base (textiles, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, steel, chemicals, handicrafts). Lahore is the economic, financial, commercial, educational, and cultural hub of Punjab, with most of Punjab’s economic activity concentrated in this city. Even the so-called “high-value” production hubs you mention—Sialkot, Faisalabad, Gujrat—are dependent on Lahore’s consumer market, logistics network, and financial ecosystem. A significant number of KSE-100 firms are headquartered here. Lahore is to Pakistan what Delhi is to India—it is quite literally the second-largest economic hub in the country. 
 Your third paragraph is so riddled with oversimplifications that it barely warrants a response, but here’s one anyway. Karachi is the primary financial center of Pakistan, but Lahore is the second-largest financial hub. Minerals in Balochistan and KPK? Sure. But those provinces also suffer from instability and governance issues that prevent them from contributing proportionally to the national economy. As a result, they receive the highest per capita federal funding despite contributing the least to federal revenue. Punjab, which has the highest GDP, gets the lowest per capita funding. Gwadar Port isn’t even fully operational yet, so bringing it up is irrelevant. Also, Northern Punjab has the highest industrial output in the province, so your claim about its lack of contribution is outright false. 
 Normal countries do not behave this way.
 
 Your entire argument proves you have no clue how “normal” countries function. Lahore gets funding for the same reason Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore do—because it drives economic activity and growth. Modern economies are services- and logistics-based, not industrial. That’s why New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, and Moscow—all leading global cities—are service economies, not manufacturing hubs. You are decades behind in your understanding of urban economies. 
 Lastly, your claim that “Lahore contributes nothing economically” is so laughably uninformed that not even a high-schooler with basic research skills would make it. If you’re going to push arguments based on sheer misinformation, at least do the bare minimum and fact-check yourself before embarrassing yourself in public. You’ve made the assertion—now prove that Lahore gets more federal funding than it contributes to the economy. The burden of proof is on you.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ix9cjz/i_have_some_hate_for_everyone/
Reddit,I have some hate for everyone,Ok_Enthusiasm4124,"It’s good that you have sparked a fact based conversation here, let’s run through some numbers shall we. Province wise: Punjab gets around 35% of the national budget, Sindh gets around 30% and rest is divided between the other areas. 
 Now here is what each city contributes to the national economy.

 Now that we have determined Lahore contributes 11.5% and Rawalpindi and Islamabad collectively contributes 2.1% let’s see how much they spend shall we. Btw not all GDP is created equal. Export oriented GDP is more concentrated in cities like Faisalabad, Karachi, Sialkot more than it is in Islamabad, Pindi. You mention USA but USA has moved from industrialized economy to service based economy, Pakistan is yet to industrialize, we are not in the same position. Pakistan should be prioritizing its bread winners which is the cities which exports the most.

 So of the total Punjab budget which is around 35% of the total national budget one-third of it goes to Lahore which makes its total spending to around 11% of the budget which does go in line of what it contributes to the economy fair enough. You were right. Let’s see Pindi and Islamabad now. Pindi contributes meager 1% yet consumes 10% of the Punjab budget 3 times of what it actually contributes. Faisalabad produces 5% of Pakistan’s GDP yet only spends half of what it contributes, unfortunately it’s the same case with gujranwala, Sialkot and multan where they contribute more than they consume. In a way you were right blasting Lahore certainly doesn’t make sense, Pindi and Islamabad are the true criminals here.

Reddit,Genuine Question: How do people live with salaries between 20-40k?,khan_54,"I totally agree with your sentiment. The things that are bare necessity for an average person in developed countries are a luxury here that only wealthy people enjoy. 
 I think that guy is a young lad living with his parents who afford everything for him so he has no expenses or responsibilities. This is quite common here. 
 I see married people with multiple kids getting by under 100k because they live in joint families so a lot of the expenses are distributed among several earning members of that joint family. 
 In the west people usually live independently/nuclear (which is good, it makes people resilient and more ambitious to grow than to be dependent on other family members) so rent alone costs $1000 on average, which is 280k pkr. Here average rent for middle-class is under $500, usually somewhere arouns $150-300.  
 Plus a lot of additional expenses such as car insurance, health insurance, and other insurances are a norm for everyone in west. Groceries, clothing, and other stuff are a lot more expensive as well. 
 So that's why someone in west barely gets by with a  $3000-$4000 monthly income, whereas the same amount here would be considered handsome income and person would be classified as upper middle class. Not that they would enjoy the same quality of life as an upper-middle class westerner, but it is what it is.

How much you learn after that is really up to the student. A school that costs 10x KPS isn't going to provide you 10x better education, it's just gonna end up going into air conditioning, bells and whistles, fancy events, etc. 
 If you park the difference between the fees into a savings account, let's say in one year you've put 10 lakh into the account. By the time your kid gets from Grade 5 to Grade 10, even if you stop putting any money into the account after that, you'll have compounded 2,540,593 rupees, 1.5x the original deposit. 
 If you want a halal option, put the difference into stocks. But imo, beyond a certain point, throwing more money into schooling is insane. Save that and you can get your kids into a very expensive university, or help them start a business, or just give them a head start in their professional career. 
 And just FYI, if you contribute 1 lakh a month for that whole 5 year period, you'll have invested 6,100,000 in that period, and compounded to 9,272,169. That's nearly 93 lakh my guy. Spending that much on a school isn't caring for your child, it's fiscal irresponsibility. Give the 93 lakh you save and accrue, they'll thank you for it.

 Secondly, historically punjabis have been docile. Throughout the history they have been ruled over by foreign powers. Their main aim, farming and agriculture.  But , when it comes to protection of their fin and kith, they have moved mountains.  
 All punjabi movies (that evolve from your tradition and culture) show how force is applied for attaining love or protection of loved ones. Hence i negate your point.

Punjabis only good at making food, yet so many of Pakistan's artists, sportsmen, engineers and businessmen are Punjabis, Punjabis are in the streets now protesting. 
The title is about gun culture, which could be debated, but 80% of the post is nothing to do with gun culture but just misplaced worship and denigration mythical images of Pashtuns, Punjabis and Sindhis. You even know it's garbage, because you mention the Taliban but say ""that's not Pashtun, it's Deobandi"" and won't extrapolate the negatives parts of the Pashtun population to all Pashtuns, but with Punjabis/Sindhis you extrapolate the negative parts of the populations to the whole population. 
""pashtun; their men - if properly nurtured - grow up to be extremely brave and do impressive feats"" - sherlock holmes sahab - you can say this about any people. This is like some 1800s racial pseudoscience.

Reddit,Pashtun Gun culture has great to part to play in them being safe from police rapes and Punjabi Army brutalities; Punjabis and Sindhis should take notes,1by1is3,"You are one the right path of understanding differences in culture. Once you understand difference in culture then you start understanding how things really are. All cultures have good and bad, once you understand those you are better equipped and more informed to understand what the hell is going around us. 
 Punjabi culture has an emphasis on lot more outward bluster and pomp that does not translate to action. You see this Punjabi dominated institutions such as the army. They continuously talk big and bluster against India but does not want to push too much to rattle the status quo. You even see this in Punjabi politicians, making big stupid claims to win votes (and people believing them).. 
Unfortunately as biggest ethnic group that has complete control over state institutions, these characteristics are not good for statecraft. Generals control foriegn policy but they military nature can't do diplomacy. Result? Failure. Politciains rely on biradari and caste votes, rather than performance. Big slogans are used for everyone else. Traders and Industrialists are not innovative at all, and rely on rent seeking, very few trading castes in Punjab that know wtf they are doing. Farming is the only thing they are good at but since all state institutions have failed or are filled with incompetent people seeking subsides and rent, farming sector is neglected and is left behind and hasn't entered the 21st century. 
 This is not to say that Punjabis or Punjabi culture is bad, there are lot of positive points.. Punjabis wear heart on their sleeves, very social,  and outward looking, usually more liberal than peer ethnic groups and more accepting of outsiders. Unfortunately these things are not enough to run a country of 250 million competently, and it shows because as Punjabis have grown more powerful in Pakistan, the trajectory of the country has stagnated.  
 Pasthuns are hardworking and innovative, have concept of ghairat, but their downsides are that they are needlessly conservative, a bit more naive and gullible than their peers. Pasthun track record of running a state is not good either (see Afghanistan). 
 All diverse ethnic groups have pros and cons in their cultures, but because Punjab dominates, they get more criticism since the negatives of their culture matter more and effect everyone else. Only if we had used every culture's strength appropriately, but alas. India got it figured out eventually.",2 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13u60eu/pashtun_gun_culture_has_great_to_part_to_play_in/
Reddit,Pashtun Gun culture has great to part to play in them being safe from police rapes and Punjabi Army brutalities; Punjabis and Sindhis should take notes,Yushaalmuhajir,"Lax gun laws aren’t the cause of mass shootings in America.  Most European countries have laws that allow the ownership of similar guns (I run in collectors circles and many of the Europeans have nicer collections than I have in the states).  Mass shootings in the US are fairly rare when not involving gang violence.  The main cause is the American attitude of individualism, it’s a toxic type that turns people selfish so when things don’t go their way they blame everyone else and have narcissism reinforced by how atomized people are there.  Pakistan has a selfishness problem too but not to the same extent the US has (it’s a different kind of selfish).  Even if you take away guns it won’t stop ever (especially in the US, there are too many there and the bad actors will never turn their’s in). 
 And I live in Pakistan, but I’m American.  Living here as a foreigner is even worse in some ways (everyone here thinks I’m rich even though I came from a very blue collar background and the only reason I have a nice collection was because I was financially irresponsible in my younger days).  Foreigners can’t own guns, they can’t drive, they can’t buy agricultural land, and even the few rights that we do have with POCs most government folks or even private sector folks have no idea that it is a stand in for a CNIC so you’re denied services that you’d otherwise be allowed to have.  Not being armed and being someone that sticks out like a sore thumb is a dangerous combination, but one I have to live with if I ever hope to become a citizen here. 
 As to Afghanistan, the combat was part of the reason.  I was there actually as a soldier, the body bags coming home being plastered all over the news had an effect which influenced US policy (they sent more troops but had very tight rules of engagement to the point that you couldn’t even shoot at someone unless they shot first and you couldn’t keep shooting if they stopped).  The US wanted to set up a puppet government in both Iraq and Afghanistan (or at least one that would be friendly with the US), the civilian resistance made it impossible.  The Afghan military were tyrants as well as the police (here police ask for rishwat, there, they just took what they wanted and there wasn’t anything you could do about it).  Everything I experienced there just reinforced my belief that the best societies are armed societies (and the Afghans were armed, under the US puppet government they could possess one AK per household, but AKs didn’t do shit against MRAPs).  Here they literally make them out of scrap metal, it’s impossible to eliminate illegal guns so why not level the playing field and let law abiding people own them too?  You and I both know the 40 licenses per month quota in Karachi isn’t going to people like you and me.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13u60eu/pashtun_gun_culture_has_great_to_part_to_play_in/

 Mostly whenever you shove a serious legal threat to these rotten corporates only then their puppet masters wake up and start to care just enough to listen to you & resolve your matter.

It is similar everywhere, people fight legal battles & get their rights. Here in Pakistan, we've opted shortcuts; we need it in minutes. It takes time, but the haqq prevails.

 Khichdi is a traditional comfort food made by cooking rice and lentils together in one pot, often with mild spices. Think of it a bit like a porridge or stew, but instead of oats or barley, it’s rice and lentils. 
 It’s usually soft, warm, and easy to digest — the kind of thing people eat when they’re sick, want something light, or just want homely food. 
 You can keep it plain (just rice and lentils, like a savoury porridge), or add vegetables and spices for more flavour. 
 it’s often compared to what mashed potatoes or chicken soup might be in Ireland — a simple, soothing dish that reminds you of home.

Reddit,The only country that sends you to jail for feeding people,after-life,"In Islam, being Muslim isn’t just a label—it’s defined by clear core beliefs, like belief in the finality of Prophethood, which is directly stated in the Qur'an (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40). Ahmadis reject this, which is why they aren’t considered Muslim according to Islamic teachings and why they’ve been declared non-Muslims under Pakistani law. 
 
 Nowhere in the Quran does it support this idea. The words Muslim and Islam are used in the Quran in a completely different context in a more general sense rather than words describing a specific name of a religion. The Quran calls previous prophets Muslims. Muslim means an individual that surrenders to something higher in order to attain peace and security, Islam is the state of surrendering. None of these are religious words or phrases, you people turned it into one. 
 
 It’s not about “owning” a word—it’s about protecting the religious meaning behind it.
Every religion has the right to define its core beliefs. You can’t reject Christianity’s core teachings and still claim to be Christian either—it’s the same principle. 
 
 Religions are created in the minds of people, they don't exist in the real world. There's no such thing as Christianity since everyone who calls themselves Christian has their own personal idea of what Christianity means and what it entails to be a Christian. Christianity cannot be compared to Islam since Christianity as a word does not exist in the Bible. Islam does exist in the Quran, so we have to take the Quranic understanding of it, not your flawed understanding of it. 
 
 Countries like Pakistan have laws to protect those boundaries, especially because religion plays a major role there. You may not like it, but it’s not about “stone age thinking”—it’s about preserving religious identity. 
 
 It is 100% stone age thinking. What Pakistan is protecting is their own flawed understanding of a concept that has been butchered through a poor comprehension of a book that was compiled 1400 years ago and expecting people in the modern century to conform to those ideas. This is 100% stone age thinking, because it's completely irrational. What Pakistan is protecting is ultimately their narrow minded view and definitions of words that they agreed upon through their own personal consensus based on no good evidence or authorization from anything. It's the appeal to popularity fallacy. 
 Even if their understanding of Islam was correct and based on the Quran (which it isn't), it still does not give them the authority and right to dictate the use of language upon people that inherently are unspecific and non normative. Muslim and islam are non normative words which anyone can use, they are not unique or special to the Quran either, they are Arabic words, and creating laws trying to restrict and gatekeep language on this level is a perfect example of corruption.",4 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1lu0y0c/the_only_country_that_sends_you_to_jail_for/
Reddit,The only country that sends you to jail for feeding people,Affi8,"You’re comparing two completely different situations here. 
 In Pakistan, Ahmadis aren’t just holding different views—they openly reject one of the most fundamental parts of Islam: the belief that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the final prophet, which is directly mentioned in the Qur'an (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40).
That’s not a minor disagreement—it’s literally something that takes them outside of Islam according to the consensus of all major scholars from all schools of thought. 
 That’s why, both religiously and legally, Pakistan doesn’t recognize them as Muslims. When they continue to claim they are Muslim despite this, it’s seen as religious misrepresentation, not just a matter of “personal freedom.” 
 Your comparison to Islamophobia laws in the West doesn’t apply here. Muslims in the West aren’t pretending to belong to another religion or violating its core beliefs—they’re simply practicing their faith openly. That’s not what’s happening here. Ahmadis are literally rejecting Islam’s most fundamental belief and still trying to use the Muslim identity, which makes it a completely different issue.

 Ahmadis believe in a prophet after Muhammad ﷺ, which is why they are not considered Muslims according to Islamic theology. Presenting themselves as Muslims despite rejecting this fundamental belief is viewed as misleading in religious terms. 
 In Pakistan, this theological belief has been written into law under the Constitution and Penal Code (Section 298-C), which is why it becomes a legal issue there too.

 Your beliefs and interpretations of a text and/or religion or ideology is still your own. There are many people who disagree with your definition, so you do not possess an authority to declare who is what. 
 A country arbitrarily picking a meaning is one thing, but codifying it into law and forcing its citizens to abide by that is a breach of basic human rights, since people should be free to practice their own faiths as long as it isn't causing real tangible harm. This type of law in Pakistan is a form of injustice, something other countries have figured out long ago. 
 The Quran says let there be no compulsion in the Deen. You cannot force your worldview on others, and you cannot create a nation that compels people to abide by your way of thinking. This is important enough that the Quran even talks about it.

Reddit,The only country that sends you to jail for feeding people,Affi8,"Every society—whether secular or religious—defines its legal framework based on its collective values.
Pakistan chose its laws through its democratic process and constitutional amendments, reflecting the beliefs of its majority population. That’s not “arbitrary”—it’s how every country works. Secular states impose secular values; Pakistan chose Islamic ones. 
 You’re free to disagree with those laws, but that doesn’t make them unjust or “stone age.” Many Muslims, including all major Islamic scholars for over a thousand years, agree with these laws based on their understanding of the Qur'an and the consensus of the Ummah. 
 Also, from an Islamic perspective, this issue goes beyond just legal definitions or personal opinions. The Shahada itself—the very first pillar of Islam—states, “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.”
Denying Muhammad ﷺ as the final messenger effectively rejects the Shahada, which is why Ahmadis are not considered Muslims according to the consensus of all major scholars, both Sunni and Shia. 
 You also can’t ignore that “no compulsion in religion” doesn’t mean abolishing religious laws in a religious society. That verse means people can’t be forced to convert—but it doesn’t mean a Muslim-majority society cannot define religious and legal boundaries for itself.

 Making the same fallacies again. There's no reason for me to keep repeating myself. You talk about collective values not realizing that the government has a responsibility to ensure those collective values are just. If everyone in your country believes it's okay to kill black people for example, it doesn't make it right. Doesn't matter if there's some ancient religion that teaches it.

 There's nothing about converting in that verse. There's nothing about converting in the entirety of the Quran. There's nothing about Islam being a religion in the Quran either. There's everything in the Quran about upholding and maintaining justice, using reason and intellect, and not blindly following the majority, not following scholars, and not inventing falsehoods in order to oppress.

It's a form of injustice, oppression, and tyranny. Pakistan continues to suffer and pay the price for its backwards laws, the country has only been going downhill.

 You're being called out for your oppressive beliefs, you can sugarcoat that in whatever way you want to make yourself feel better. You are still an oppressor. You have the right to your personal beliefs, you can believe that Ahmadis are not ""true Muslims"" the same way I can say you are not a true Muslim. However, promoting the idea that your personalized religious beliefs should be mandated as law in a nation of people who all have differing beliefs is a form of tyranny. 
 You promote tyrannical oppression which leads to injustice and violence. You might proclaim from your tongue that you do not support violence and oppression, but every iota of your actions shows otherwise. 
 
 You’ve admitted yourself that even if a society chooses religious laws through democratic means, you’d still call it “oppression.” That shows this isn’t about justice for you—it’s about forcing your version of “justice” on everyone else, whether they agree or not. 
 
 That's not what I said. If a society chooses laws founded in their religious doctrine but those laws are still just, there's nothing wrong with that. Thomas Jefferson had his own personal Quran and was inspired by it and other scriptures and documents when writing the constitution of the United States. All of this is valid. But when you create laws and rulings that come from religion and they are oppressive, then you are a tyrant. 
 
 Also, comparing a country’s religious laws to something like “killing black people” is not just absurd—it’s desperate. That’s not an argument; it’s emotional blackmail.

It sounds like you've had a lot of pressure placed on you from a young age, and your emotions are completely valid. You grew up in a strict and controlled environment where your autonomy was limited, and now, even as an adult, you're still struggling to find your own space and identity. That’s exhausting, and it's understandable that you feel drained. 
 Your family's expectations, especially regarding academics and social life, have clearly impacted your mental health. You're juggling immense pressure while trying to keep everyone happy, which is an unfair burden. It’s okay to feel resentment and exhaustion, it doesn’t mean you don’t love your family, it just means you need space and respect as an individual. 
 It seems like your emotions, needs, and even your well-being have been sidelined in favor of family expectations. You deserve to be heard and have your needs acknowledged. It's not selfish to want privacy, independence, and a break from constant social demands. You're not abnormal or defective; you're a person with different needs, and that should be respected. 
 Your feelings of being stuck between cultural expectations and your own desires are valid. It’s hard to push against deeply ingrained family norms, but you deserve a life where you feel in control of your choices. You may not be able to change your family’s mindset completely, but you can start by setting small boundaries for your own peace of mind. 
 If possible, seek support from people who understand, whether that’s a therapist, a friend, or even online communities where others have been through similar experiences.

 * Emotional Restraint and Lack of Autonomy:
   * The author feels her life has been overly controlled and restricted, hindering her personal growth and exploration of interests.
   * She desires more autonomy and freedom, particularly regarding personal choices, social interactions, and career paths.
 * Misunderstanding and Lack of Empathy:
   * She feels her parents don’t understand her emotional needs, particularly her introversion and potential autism.
   * There’s a sense of feeling unheard and invalidated, with her feelings and experiences often dismissed.
 * Cultural and Gender Expectations:
   * She’s burdened by strict cultural and gender expectations, leading to double standards and limitations on her freedom.
   * The culture of the family and expectations placed on the women in the family is a massive contributing factor to her distress.
 * Desire for Validation and Support:
   * The author seeks validation for her feelings and a sense of normalcy, wanting to know if her experiences are relatable.
   * She’s looking for support and guidance in navigating her complex family dynamics.
 * The intent of the post:

Them not letting you have a phone or social media till turning 18 and constant academic pressure is just so wrong.

Best case scenario become financially independent and hopefully in the future find a partner who is loving, caring and have the same values as you and understands values as you someone who understands the importance of emotional support, mutual respect, and unconditional love in a relationship. You deserve to be in an environment where you feel safe, valued, and cared for, not one where love is conditional or withheld based on arbitrary rules. 
 Parental love should be a source of comfort, not something that feels distant or transactional. It’s heartbreaking when cultural or conservative beliefs come at the cost of a child’s emotional well-being. While it’s true that your parents likely won’t change their mindset, you have the power to shape your own future one where you set the standards for what love, respect, and emotional support should look like. 
 For now, focus on becoming financially independent, building a strong support system with friends who genuinely care about you, and eventually surrounding yourself with people who offer the warmth and understanding that every human being deserves.

Reddit,Today I experienced religious bigotry firsthand by a fellow Muslim.,pestunlence,"Yes you can search them on sunnah.com to see the hadith, to see when they were revealed. 
 I have read the Quran start to finish twice. Once to become a more dedicated muslim, as my family is quite ""loose"" with practise and I felt like I needed to study and pray more etc. Second time when I felt uncomfortable with the teachings scholars gave, since the same scholar would change narratives and not really answer my questions. Started a third read after imam told me to listen with my heart etc etc and not ask so much but honestly I just can't anymore. It's clear that the answers will always be ""it was a different time"" and ""it's out of context"" and ""hadith can't be trusted... [next week] here's a hadith we are gonna follow"" i just can't apologise for it anymore. I fought my young life away, fought to align these verses with what modern standards of morality are, and finding the ""real islam"". 
 That's why I'm glad I found your post. Because i had a negative view of Pakistan (because of the strict teachings, and elusive scholars who insult people, i see on popular islamic media from there).  
 But this thread made me feel like there are more of you (OP) than i thought, who prioritise human life and harmony.

Reddit,Today I experienced religious bigotry firsthand by a fellow Muslim.,pestunlence,"Yeah I know the whole verse and how does the context change what I said? They all deserve destruction for being born into a religion. And that whole verse is so ridiculous because no jews ever believed Ezra was God's son or whatever, jews don't have a messiah they are still waiting for the messiah, that's what makes them jews. And no Christian has ever believed that god had sex, the whole point is that he is not human and had no human desires and is omnipotent and omniscient.  
 Anyway, point is... it says they deserve destruction by the merciful Allah who sends people who dedicate their lives to helping other, to hell for not worshipping him. But i can have slaves and 4 women and be in charge of them, and beat my children, but worship Allah and go to jannah. So merciful. 
 And (1) or (2) changes nothing. Who goes to the fire of hell forever? People who don't fast, women who don't cover, people who dont follow Muhammad... they all go to hell. So (1) and (2) are the same.  
 Hadith is worse than Quran. It shows the slave trade of Muhammad, that Aisha was a child when she was married, that Muhammad gave men permission to beat their women, ordered people to be stoned to death, said women are ""deficient in intelligence and religion"", and broke peace agreements to expel jews from Arabia. The sahih hadith is less ""up for interpretation"" and if you want ""context"" for anything it's way more vile.

Reddit,Today I experienced religious bigotry firsthand by a fellow Muslim.,The-Khan-Man,"Regarding the food, this misconception is something unfortunately found in Pakistan while its simply untrue. The Qur'an says 
 ""The food of the people of earlier revelations (i.e. Christians and Jews) is permissible for you and yours is permissible for them-""  (Quran 5: 5) 
 We can clearly see that Muslims are even allowed to eat slaughtered food by Christians and Jews, then who in their right minds thought that we can't eat any food touched by them? Its just Muslims being uneducated in their own religion unfortunately. (Also, just for the sake of clarity, there is pretty much no longer any Christian butcheries in the western world which would fall under that category. Most meat usually comes from factories which don't adhere to that standard so the vast majority of it is still not halal. Kosher food is still fine. However, this still has nothing to do with someone touching the food, that's just ignorance or misinformation). 
 Furthermore, The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said 
 ""Beware, if anyone wrongs a   mu`ahid   [i.e. a non-Muslim enjoying the protection of Muslims], or diminishes his right, or forces him to work beyond his capacity, or takes from him anything without his consent, I shall be his adversary on the Day of Judgment ” - (Abu Dawud). 
 Any minority which lives in the Islamic republic of Pakistan enjoys the protection of their rights, or at least that's how its supposed to be. That young Christian mans right to employment was diminished effectively making the Prophet of Islam an adversary. Show this to your boss or whoever and try to convince them to re-interview that young man without bias.

Reddit,Today I experienced religious bigotry firsthand by a fellow Muslim.,TheFlyingBadman,"Jeez. That's some mental gymnastics, man. Objective or subjective interpretation is exactly the point here. I will give you a simple analogy of subjective and objective.

 Subjective = Islam is just a lie Arabs came up with. The Greek pantheon are the only true gods.

Reddit,Today I experienced religious bigotry firsthand by a fellow Muslim.,TheFlyingBadman,"No, wrong. Opinion is something that is your personal view on a certain matter. An opinion can also be objective and subjective. An objective fact is an absolute truth. It's not a truth that is fluid based on the perception of different people.  
 Philosophy itself is not at all an objective science. Sure some niches of philosophy do explore objective thought but theology is not one of them. 
 If you want to cite objective facts about human psyche and behaviour (such as altruism or sadism), I think we should be discussing scientific fields like psychology and psychiatry. There is a whole sub-discipline that studies connection of human-brain and religiosity. But I'm afraid, I have to reject your claim that it is widely accepted fact that the only source of morality in humans are religious texts. This is not true.  
 Morality did initially arise from religion because it was the easiest path. But religion is not the only source for it. Atheists and non-believers don't suddenly start killing and maiming people as soon as they renounce their beliefs lol. They still love their families and live lawful and happy lives. 
 Otherwise, wouldn't the naked natives of the Amazon forests which don't even have a written language would've been killing and robbing each other more than the civilized religious Lahoris and Karachiites, and not the other way around. 
 Morality is an intrinsic part of human intelligence and it definitely develops from the complex interactions between neural structures and chemicals. Religion is nothing but an attempt of human intelligence to explain what it doesn't comprehend on first sight.  
 As science explained more and more of the anomalies, the formation of new religions also stopped at an increasing pace.

Previously, before Islam, the Jews and  Christians were given the same set of rules as Muslims for slaughter but later they changed or corrupted it and today even Kosher meat is not advisable because most Jews don't even follow the rulings that were given to them.

 Yes that's true. Not all of them are about the Prophet SAWA though.  
 
 If I had to pray to anyone to ask for intercession, it would be to the Prophet (PBUH). 
 
 Of course.  
 
 We don’t do that though because he told us not to.

 This ain’t talking about your random “saints”. It clearly says except those whom Allah has given permission 
 
 Yes those would be the Prophet SAWA and his Aal.  
 
 The randoms in Pakistan ain’t it sorry. 
 
 Of course, the babas and stuff. I'm not talking about that. I just wanted to tell you that intercession and istighatha is halal. Even if we ignore the Quran for two seconds, we use intercession and intercessors almost daily. Imagine, Naudbillah, that you became very sick and that you have to go to the doctor. The doctor gives you medicine. You take the medicine and are fixed. Question is, what or who fixed you? Allah or the medicine? Of course Allah, but he helped you through the medicine. That's istighatha. Now imagine you go up to your mom and say to her ""Mom please pray for me"". That's Tawassul. These are very easy concepts to understand, unfortunately people have made intercession a business.

 As more and more people come to Pakistan from the gulf/go and work there. There is cultural dispersion that happens and certain Wahabi/Salafi elements creep into our practice. 
 The modern mind finds it easy to believe in the hard rigid contours of Salafism - then in some of spiritual nuances of Mysticism/Barelivis. 
 The infamy brought about by Fake Sheikhs and Pirs doesn’t help the cause.

 Not to mention the horrible reputation that TLP has got amongst so many Pakistanis, with their staunch intolerant stand on everyone, attacking Qadiani mosques, lobbying to get the blasphemy punishments, etc. That doesn't really go along well with most people.  
 Although majority of Pakistanis can say that their roots are Barelvis (grandparents, etc.), the majority of seminaries in Pakistan are all run by Deobandis, and with Tablighi culture becoming quite big, and the adab of the Deobandis being very good (ex. Maulana Tariq Jamil), it's much easier for people to learn about the Deobandi understanding and shift sides. 
 Furthermore, on social media whenever someone searches for Islamic content, you will often find the Salafi scholars answering questions or creating more content, and often times it's much better than any content put out by Barelvi preachers, and the work done by Youth Club in particular is undeniable and no one is putting out that level of engaging content and putting in effort to bring people towards practicing the deen.

 Salafism is easy the way Islam is supposed to be.  There are no asinine temple/darga dancing and we visit 3 masajid for pilgrimages without praying to anyone but Allah.  We don't need anyone else to intervene for us, Allah is all powerful and the most merciful at the same time, so there's nothing a human (much less a dead one) could do for us while Allah can do anything.  He turned my heart when I was the biggest islamophobe in the world without anyone's help (maybe a helpful nudge from a brother who invited me to Islam, but it was years later when I took that invitation).  Sufism in of itself isn't bad but it can lead to crazy innovations and stuff like that so you have to be careful with it.  It's better to either stick to one madhab or one sheikh you know is on the Haqq to the best of your ability.

Reddit,Why is the economy constantly sliding?,homsickprogrammer,"Its simple. You need money(rupee) to survive in Pakistan, if you don't have rupee you can't do much in Pakistan.  
 Same goes with your country as one entity, Pakistan as a country doesn't have dollar(international currency), and its difficult to survive. 
 Think of it as, some food place, who have that token system as administration, you buy that token then buy stuff from that food place in exchange. Now, That token is useless outside of that specific place, outside you need rupee else no one will give you anything. 
 This idea goes further, and internationally, you need to get dollars first, to buy gas, petrol, medicine, electronics, any thing........ 
 Why Pakistan can't earn dollar like rest? Well, in the 1980s our leaders didn't take energy needs seriously, like they didn't make long term plans for next generation. Why I am saying that? well, when Pakistan was struggling from electricity shortage in 2000-2018, its solution was in 1980s, where you were supposed to construct big dams, that would take 10-20 years for completion, and Billions of dollar. Normally that's how it takes. You can't construct a dam in 1 year, which can serve 200 Million people. 
 So, no one took it seriously, and then came 2000s with population boom. You have no electricity for more than 12 hours so you can't industrialize yourself. You can't create jobs, make stuff, export earn dollars which gonna keep the progress going. 
 What did you do? Well, government in 2000s just took American dollars from Aid, loans and made it available for cheap 40-50 rupee. So, everyone started their import business. That create jobs. 
 Government printed rupee out of thin air, starts random projects with local labor, that circulates money in the population. In return people exchange that rupee out of thin air for Dollar, and comes imports. 
 Today, you have 65 Billion dollar worth of Import based ecnomoy. While your earning of dollar is less than 30 Billion. How do you handle the different ? Through loans, aid and remittances.  
 Now, you are struggling to get new loans and you have interest to pay on previous ones. 
 Whats the solution? well, get ready for chitrool after that there might be some light.",150 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/qxkcd0/why_is_the_economy_constantly_sliding/

 True but it's also worrisome how that export is coming at the cost of an increased Trade deficit. 
 Yes the government says that the increase in trade deficit is driven by machinery imports for the industry but from the data it would seem that general machinery imports a year prior to PTI had reached highs which have yet to be seen during PTI's tenure. So unless i am missing something here this is clearly a lie they are telling the masses to cover the fact that these exports are driven by import driven policies designed to give preferential treatment to assembly lines.

 Secondly huge addition of food imports again thanks to PMLN. 0.6% growth in crops production meanwhile population growing 2+%/year so food imports are on the rise. 
 Thirdly investing in export based model which will increase the imports but for the good of exports later i.e machinery etc. Unlike import based model that discourages exports. 
 Lastly Pakistan doesn't have any speciality it will take time to create something that will take part in growth of exports but the first thing is to set export based policy without worrying oh it will just further increase imports.

Reddit,Why is the economy constantly sliding?,WonderMonk007,"Country is quickly becoming like Afghanistan rather than Bangladesh. Development gap compared to Bangladesh will keep on increasing and more and likewise gap will shrink when compared to Afghanistan.  
 Major source of economy is what:
Tariffs collected in imports is 48% of total tax collection.  
 Even now food is imported.  
 What is exported - some textile, some leather goods, and maybe Little bit more?  About 60% is exported to US. And curse them in all proceedings.  
 Export recently rose only because other exporting nations were under lockdown (so substitution) and as many opened now so will see drop in exports as well.  
 There are several fatal flaws in economy and many includes failures to understand situation and adapt policies for it.  
 Country is currently run on Foreign loan, aid, remittances. Export maybe a small contributing factor too. In past a wide assumption was made that tap of foreign funding will keep on wide open because of geographical position (shhh. Next door to Afghanistan a playground of empires.). Now these empires are bored of game and took off from playground so tap is shut to trickle mode and maybe will be shut (not in recent future). So big chunk of input is dried and China Bahadur is not opening another tap but instead asking interest and fines back. Tkry jaan only giving tv serials rights and no more dough.

Reddit,Why is the economy constantly sliding?,NoUtimesinfinite,"On one hand, you say PTI is doing the same shit PMLN did while on the other, you say PMLN could have done better? 
 The economic problems of this country are simple. Low exports and high imports. Only way to solve it is to turn it around, nothing else will solve the issue and will only delay the inevitable. 
 And how do you solve it? Have a free floating rupee to reflect its actual value and focus on exports. PMLN did none of that, PTI has taken those measures and they will def be painful and will take time to implement. As for the $1.2 billion you say, thats not a sustained long term policy to inflating the rupee unlike what PMLN did. It was there to stop the rupee freefall due to rising import bill and prevent a two front rise in inflation. I know Pakistan collectively has a really small attention span but i do remember the days pre covid where a lot of ppl supported the govts economic policies. Tax collection increased, CAD decreased, reserves increased, dollar got stable bw 150-160 where it was free floating, govt losses decreased, human development investment increased etc. Sure there were missmanagements and i wouldnt expect everything to work smoothly during PTI.  
 Then covid hit and given how PPP and PMLN wanted to shut everything down and gave the govt hell for keeping stuff open. I want someone to really think deeply and truthfully answer if either of those two would have handled covid lockdown as well as PTI did. All i would have excepted was either complete lockdowns or complete disregard with us reaching a similar case to india. The covid and beyond global economic conditions have been bad globally but for a country without much reserves to spend on ppl and to counter supply side inflation, things have been bad. I know the conditions in Pakistan very well and they have been very hard on a lot of ppl but this current inflation isnt just due to mismanagement or bowing down to mafias etc.  In Pakistan, everything relies on oil and gas and there just isn't any simple way to reduce its price. Tax and levies on it are as low as they can be. The rest is what the govt can buy it at which is sky high rn. Food could have been managed better but even their transportation, storage etc costs increase with oil increase. 
 On every post like this, i have a simple question. What do you think PMLN or PPP could have done to have us in a different economic situation rn.  
 (Lets leave the TTP TLP stuff out cause i dont agree with PTIs stance and wish they did better.

Reddit,Why is the economy constantly sliding?,1by1is3,"The biggest cost is the factory, plant and equipment. Nobody will wanna invest if your capital is losing 10% per annum just because of currency devaluation.  
 The only cost that actually falls is labor. But as we know, labor is not only cheap in Pakistan but also in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and several other countries. 
 China keeping its currency low, and Chinese currency losing 10% of its value every year are two very different things. The first is still a stable currency and stable investing environment. The second is instability and anti investment.  
 Also you need to understand that the Chinese central banks buys up US treasuries by selling Chinese currency and keep Chinese currency low. They can do so because China is already exporting WAY more than they import. Pakistan cannot do this because Pakistan is not exporting anything so demand for PKR is even lower, and creating more PKR only causes inflation.",-2 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/qxkcd0/why_is_the_economy_constantly_sliding/

Reddit,Why is the economy constantly sliding?,holykamina,"Short answer: Not enough resources, COVID, FATF list 
 Long answer: The downfall started when Pakistan took part in war on terror. While money was being poured into Pakistan in shape of aid and toys for army, it triggered decades of abuse at the hands of terrorism. This pushed out a lot of foreign investment because no one would want to operate in a country where they are not safe. In addition, emergence of MQM and their tactics to divide the country on ethnic basis strangled growth in one of the key cities called Karachi. PPP holding back other regions of Sindh is another blow to the growth of an entire province. Same with Balochistan, where political parties funneled public findings into their personal accounts. With decades of abuse, terrorism and political interference, the wealth inequality grew. This pushed people towards poverty and created a gap so big which caused rich to get richer while poor got poorer. In return, we now have a large population of uneducated folks who have not even cleared high-school. This brought you HDI down and to top it off, it also brought down your economic sectors. As a result, fewer people were captured in the tax net and not to mention, people abused and evaded taxes all while the political parties got richer and richer.  On the other hand, PMLN in Punjab worked on developing infrastructure, but only limit it to Lahore and select few areas. While they focused on these mega projects, they completely ignored policies that would have favored industrialization. We now have epic bridges, underpass and busses, but lack the industry to fully utilize this infrastructure.  
 Now, let's come to education. Collectively, all political parties did poor job at bringing quality education to the point where education has become a status symbol which has caused to cut off many people from gaining access to quality education. Again, the wealth disparity comes into play here which has completely influenced how we see and treat people. Poor education leads to bad mothers, bad mothers lead to bad Nation. (You can connect the dots to see what made our society). As a result,  our society played an important part in hindering economic growth.  
 Some other issues : 
 1) Politicized census : in Pakistan, census was heavily politicized, was full of errors, and heavily pushed back by the citizens. Census just doesn't show how many kafirs are living in your country. It plays an important role in to helping develop resources, forecast population growth etc. Without this, you can't understand how much farm land do you need to fulfill local demand and what not.  
 2) Overnight richness : A good chunk of rich folks became rich overnight. A person barely able to afford food could suddenly dine at Pizza Hut and buy a Parado. Then use his new found wealth to buy their way into key institutes just to be at the top. There are few families who are genuinely rich or worked hard/legally to make money and attain a high living standard.  
 Add all of this and you get corruption, injustice, theft, and broken law and order. COVID further created problems and as you can see, prices have surged across the globe. CPi is up by 6.6% which is a huge problem. With Pakistans economy already dependent on aid, and loans, rampant inflation and dependence on foreign intervention has caused suffering to many and it will continue. You do not have the necessary funds to quickly push your country towards a corrective course. You do not have the industrial power. Pakistan economy for the most part remained a consumption based economy. Whatever you produce is in the hands of few select families and the industry is not very well regulated. 
 So to blame PTI for the current state of the economy is unfair. It's the amalgamation of decades old problems which has pushed Pakistan to this tipping point.",-2 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/qxkcd0/why_is_the_economy_constantly_sliding/

 They were experienced and competent. IK is ready to do anything to remain in power and it also suits the most powerful people here.

 Their family doesn't care about them and have practically sold them off, even stripping them of their income, and hence, the right to live/make their own choices, and that too at such a young age so growing up these kids would have no sense of self or skills to manage money  
 The family who hires them are enabling pathetic families like these. Basically telling them  it's okay to slave children and not give them a childhood 
 The kid earns his own money by working. When going out to places like these. Even if this kid was working, he would have money from his own pay to get something for himself. But he doesn't. Because his greedy family would rather he have nothing.  
 And this is very very common. It's a grey area, I don't expect my employer to pay for me when going on location based errands, heck I don't even get lunch from them. Not everyone is going to pay for their employee's lunch/TA DA. But I have the right to keep my pay for myself and use it however I like. And this kid should too. It's very cruel even seeing from the outside. You can tell who's the nanny or a maid when a family goes out. They are entrusted with feeding the child. The child loves them and they also lovingly do their duties. But you can also see (especially if the nannies are actually kids) hungrily looking at the food that is literally in their hands but they are only allowed to feed it to the family's child.

And now they are refusing the vaccine because its free, but these same morons were complaining that the vaccine wasnt available and should be free like a year ago.  
 They are then pointing and laughing in the face of danger, then bitching and moaning when things go sideways. just like right now. same concept. its a fucking tragedy. what did the kids have to do with their parents stupid choices? the kids didnt know jackshit. and therefore any surviving parent should definitely be charged, jailed and their driving licenses stripped away. They not only put their own family in danger and killed them, but they aided in jam packing a hard to reach area and made it an issue for everyone else and basically aided in the deaths and trauma of others.

 Hotel association assails admin, offers free stay for those stranded 
 Raja Yasir Abbasi, the secretary general of the Hotels Association, announced free stay and food arrangements for tourists stranded in Murree.
Speaking to DawnNewsTV, he railed against the local administration for their ""mismanagement"", saying that the death of a police officer and his family were wholly due to ""departmental and administrative laziness"".  
 He also criticised the interior minister's notification of shutting down Murree, saying it had spread fear and panic among the people.  
 The secretary general also contested declaring the area ""calamity hit"", saying that such a tag was for sudden acts of God and not for situations such as this where the Met office had predicted the rough weather ""10 days ago"".

 It absolutely does (atleast I think so, could be wrong), however that was not my point. The military's job isn't maintenance neither making arrangements nor conducting any of the tasks that were primarily assigned to the ministers and authorities of that region. 
 
 The government as a whole must be held accountable. What protocols are in place for such situations? The Mayor in Murree should have asked the governor of Punjab for help. The governor should then have arranged help (military or other) with the PM\President's help if necessary. 
 
 Yes, definitely.  
 
 And maybe that is what happened behind the scenes. Maybe the army was mobilized after all this communication. 
 
 Maybe, but this shouldn't have escalated to deaths. They should have done their work and predicted the influx of tourists. And they should have made arrangements in Murree regarding such weather conditions, maybe keep the armed forces on alert if they didn't have policemen or labour to clear the roads. And at the very least they should have clearly warned people by sending out a PSA about such weather conditions (although I don't think it was that severe personally, it was made severe due to negligence).

They use emotional blackmail to control you, and keep using it even after you're an adult and supposed to live you own life. You see so many marriages fall apart because of parents unnecessary meddling in a marriage that is SUPPOSED to be between two people only. No third person gets a say. 
 You've been emotionally manipulated to be this much guilt tripped into sacrificing your own rights. What is your idea of right and wrong in this situation? 
 Understand that you have rights. God given rights. As does your wife. No one will give them to you if you don't claim them yourself. As long as you won't man up and take a stand for yourself and your wife, you will stay in this mental torture. You have an obligation to provide a safe home for her and be ber guardian in all matters, but you do NOT have the same obligation for your parents. Understand this. Be empathetic to your wife, she left her own home to build a better one with you. 
 From 1, it's clear from your father's blackmailing how much he tramples your rights. It's your right to keep your marital life separate from your family life, and that's the only way for both to blossom independently without interference and fights. You have to take a stand for yourself and tell him straight up that it's HIM that's crossing the limits, it's him in the wrong, because you're always there if he needs you. There's no sin on you for doing the right thing, especially when your father is in the wrong. They criminalize separate living just to keep you on a leash, that's the extent they go to. 
 You need to make your mother understand that distance does not mean abandonment. Leaving your parents would be cutting off all ties and communication with them, but living 15 minutes away with frequent visits is about the most you can do for them. However, I can't imagine what she's been through with your father, you know your mother best, so i would advise you try to take care of her any way you can.

The fact he wants only you to pay rent when he knows your wife helps financially sounds to me like he is trying to earn that haq mehr back.
Also think who will be responsible for rent in the future. Will it all fall on your shoulders alone? Will you still support your brothers alone or ask them to contribute. If they don't will you leave? In all scenarios what is the likely outcome? I would think you will become bad guy either way; no matter what you do.

 The biggest problem that you are facing is the mental agony of not making everyone happy and you know that not everyone will feel the same in your situation,but do you know why? 
 Children of abusive parents become  people pleasers  It is your thought process that if i am a good boy,nothing will go wrong and that maybe I am the stimulation to my dad's crappy attitude.Your elder siblings had their own coping mechanism and they took the being indifferent to their surroundings attitude,so even if they find out that their dad is abusing their kids they might not care much,unless their wives take the time to convince them for their kids. 
 Your mom in Islam does have her rights but so does your wife.She cannot hold onto to you like that and women with unhappy marriages hold onto their kids like that(some don't) you need to talk it out with her and she needs to understand you as a parent. 
 Moving back will end your marriage and is that how you want to live? Making everyone happy but yourself? It is amazing that in todays economy you can independently live on rent so do not throw that away.Man up and fix yourself first nd the rest will follow. 
 Repeat after me: I cannot make everyone happy at the same time, 
 My dad's attitude was not because of me and he will not change so I should better distance, 
 My nieces and nephews will grow up and move on with their life so my priority should be my wife and kids. 
 If they are really my family then they will be disappointed for a short while and later accept me but if they cut ties first then they are answerable to Allah and not me as they took the initiative while i was protecting my wife's right

And since you are worried about your mom, ask her to visit you or live with you. If your dad threatens divorce, so be it. No offense but what use is a belligerent abusive old husband? She can live with you. But if your mom chooses to stay with her husband, she needs to stand up for herself where she comes to live with you every few weeks, but if she doesn’t take that stand herself too, then you can’t do too much. She is an adult. She has agency. You cannot make her decisions for her. You can only facilitate her (pick her up, drop her off  etc)  
 And you keep saying “I can’t even do this” or “ I am not even allowed to do Y” … you realize that’s absurd right? You are 33. What is someone going to do if you say no? Or choose to do what YOU want? The only weapon your dad has is verbal abuse and guilt tripping. Stop falling for it

But you not working on it is insane, and you even got married before even working on yourself just to ruin someone else’s life, thats a dick move considering you knowing how your family dynamic is like and the fact you cant separate yourself from it. Also tone down the oedipus complex, stop being obsessed with your mom like that, its out of norm thats why i call it obsession, your giving ur mom as much time as ur wife while ur siblings still with them so its not like she’s all alone, i wouldnt be surprised if your wife resembles ur mom in features or some aspects of personality that u resonate more with in ur mom and now u do in ur wife aswell, which in its own way is fucked up.

The more you capitulate and follow their instructions, the less they give a shit about your opinion.

 Regarding a separate home for your wife, it is her right to have it if you can afford it. As previous comments mentioned, joint family system is only if you can't afford to live separately otherwise it is your responsibility to provide a separate accommodation for your wife. If anyone is forcing you to live in a joint family system, ignore them and move on. Tell them that it is the right of your wife to live separately. Tell them that this is not possible no matter what they will do. Take a firm stance on it. 
 Regarding dutifulness to your parents, I don't know why do we Pakistanis have learned that no matter what our parents say we have to agree other wise we are sinning, the point is that if they tell you to follow something good you do, otherwise don't. Your wife left her home for you, you better man up and take a stand for her if she is abused or her rights are being violated by your parents. 
 One final thing which is super important is that no matter how bad your parents are, you have to take care of them. Meaning financially support them however you can, be dutiful towards them, take care of their food and clothes. But never agree to their absurd demands. If they get angry over that, just ignore and move on.

You will have to define the boundaries of each relationship. Remember, being blackmailed is your own weakness. Get rid of it. I know you may say it is easier said than done, but I have done it.
For Your father, you need to make clear that he is your father, and yes, he may have certain rights on you, but you also have certain rights on him and responsibilities for your marriage. His rights do not allow to interfere with your married life. Period. He needs to conduct himself better if he wants to have a relationship with you. You will conduct your responsibilities as a son no matter what, but he can't emotionally trigger you anymore as you refuse to take part in this abuse.
You need to lay down a similar law with your wife. Tell her if she wants to commit suicide, go ahead. But how you conduct yourself with your parents is none of her business. If she can't get along with your father, boo hoo. That is between her and your father. She can just stay separate. If you need to shift for the sake of your marriage in a different home, shift. Take your mother with you or at least have her over half a month if she doesn't want to come .
Support your parents financially as much as you can, tend to them, and make sure that they are comfortable.
The same goes for your relationship with your wife.
As far as your brothers are concerned, make it clear to them that any expenses for parents need to be divided amongst all of you. They can not put it all on you. The way you described your father, I don't think you can be held accountable for striking to maintain balance.
All of this you can do only if you man up. Remember, in any relationship or situation, it is better to suffer a loss once then to be constantly black mailed. And I have learned this the hard way.

Your brothers should make an effort to be there for her regardless of the distance, given the digital age we live in there are multiple ways they can do their part in caring for your mother. 
 Ultimately if your wife feels neglected because of your dynamic with your mother it’s reasonable as she doesn’t feel like a priority and that feeling might be worsened by the fact that now you also have a child.

 In your case, there seems to be some deeper issues between your family and your wife. Perhaps those are worth exploring. Have a sit down, call discussion with her to find out her reservations and then deal with them.  
 In our case, when we travel, typically, our family either has some food ready for us to return and eat with them (if it is reasonable hours) or a lot of times that pack it up for us that we can drop by and pickup without stopping for a longer time.

 Pretty sure the point is that he wants to visit his mother and brothers on the day of returning from traveling, which most people, esp with children and esp esp babies ie their one year old, would be totally exhausted from and want to rest when they get home. The mother and brothers literally live 15 min away as OP mentioned so they can literally see them anytime and they already do go to see them for 6 hours straight once a week regularly.  
 Nothing is stopping OP from going to see his mother himself but the wife means that  she  doesn’t want to go, and w how old fashioned our culture tends to be, I’m guessing he doesn’t know how to take of their kid esp at such a young age either so I wouldn’t blame a first time mother for not feeling comfortable w OP taking the kid somewhere without her",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1fs6671/is_my_wife_right_on_this/

 While meeting after returning sounds tiring and one would want to rest a while before, going somewhere else. And if your family is tired you can go alone and take them on the weekly scheduled time. Given that you guys don’t live very far away from your mother’s house. It is not a big deal and it is good to meet her. She is your mother, She gave birth to you and raised you. She deserves a bit of attention.  
 The way islam is dragged in this topic is simply ridiculous, if it is not your wife’s responsibility doesn’t mean you lose humanity towards your husbands parents and refuse to put even a little but of efforts. Thats just sad.  
 Honestly what i think is your wife thinks it’s a chore to even be there for your mother, which is not healthy, that’s just my take on it. There may be several other factors that might not be present in the equation here.

Reddit,Why pakistani think it's cool being obsessed to food and overeating (esp if you are man),MrNightime,"You fail to understanding the deeper reason of why Pakistanis have this love of food. In a country that has limited resources, where a large portion of the population are poor, or lower middle class, they do not have access to any other form of entertainment to keep them occupied or help them de-stress. While I also get mad of people always thinking of eating, whenever they plan for an outing. But unfortunately what other choice do they have? We have no parks. We don't have a healthy lifestyle because we cannot afford good healthy food, or activities. We don't have quality affordable entertainment. What else can they do? If the people of Pakistan are given more options, I'm sure this system could change.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1hy9rob/why_pakistani_think_its_cool_being_obsessed_to/

Reddit,My wife's 30th birthday is up. What are some good but affordable gift ideas can you suggest?,doinky_doinky,"I bought my wife a Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue perfume (Eau de toilet) from Al-Fatah for 17K during 1st week of March this year. 
I also gave her a Seiko watch, 11K, she liked it a few weeks ago when we were there, so I kept a tab on it. Again, from Al-Fatah in Centaurus. 
Along with these two things, there was a bouquet of roses, her favourite red velvet cupcakes from Layers, and Balloons and some chocolates.  
 Lesson learnt with all this effort: She loved the watch, but she hasn’t touched it since. She loves the perfume, but she’s kind of reactive to its scent, so I’m not sure about it either.  
 She loved the cupcakes, but let’s be real, she only ate 1, and that was it.  
 She loved the flowers, but flowers are just symbolic, they don’t have any practical use, and were thrown away the next day.  
 Some of the chocolates are still sitting in the fridge, and she nibbles on them just once or twice a week.  
 The balloons stayed afloat fpr a day, and were then freed into the open skies.  
 What she loved the MOST, was the effort I put. Oh boy it made her day! So, don’t worry too much about the budget, DO A LITTLE BIT of everything within your means and you’ll have a VERY VERY happy wife and happy life!

Reddit,I AM SO TIRED OF THIS,pixiegirl224,"This post showed up on my timeline as a recommendation because I am part of BollyBlindsNGossip and this was similar to it. I am giving you this heads-up since I am Indian and I want to make it clear that I am not lurking around Pakistani subs. 
 That being said, this is a recent problem. In 2016, India saw the Jio Revolution which massively increased access to dirt cheap internet to Indians. We saw internet penetration like never before. 
 2014 is also when the Hindu nationalist BJP came to power and they did so through the power of social media. 2014 was a watershed moment for India in many ways since for the first time every Social Media played a humongous role in our elections. BJP has built up a massive IT Cell whose only purpose is to troll its opponents and critics and that includes any country they perceive to be an enemy. These IT Cells have misled and brainwashed the masses as well along with our mainstream media which has become a mouthpiece for the ruling party. All in all, Indians are inundated with propaganda on all mediums and as such many are actively misled/radicalised and resort to such behaviour, many are also members of the BJP's IT Cell who do this for money. 
 I am somebody who follows the news and current affairs so I tend to follow the social media handles of all major English news media publications from all over the world as such I follow Dawn and Express Tribune from Pakistan and every time a post of their pops up on my Timeline, the comments are filled with Indians making similar comments. It is the same old taunt - ""Oh Pakistanis are begging for Atta and are poor. Mumbai has a bigger GDP than Pakistan"" and other bullshit like that which most of the time has no relevance to the actual news piece. 
 As an Indian who doesn't agree with the BJP, I can tell you this has been a huge pain in the ass for us as well. We can't access the internet without being bombarded with nationalistic bullshit. 
 On another note, it is also extremely cringe that the BJP and their followers who portray this heroic image of India are so obsessed with a neighbour of ours who is so much smaller both in physical area size and population size. You never see Americans being this obsessed with Canada or the French being this obsessed with Switzerland. 
 Weird inferiority complex of BJP supporters. If you are a minority or a woman or someone who doesn't support the BJP, they turn your life on social media into hell with the trolling and the abuse. It is filthy and soul-sucking. 
 Anyways, this is not just a Pakistani-specific issue although I do think Pakistan is targetted the most. We've seen BJP supporters do the same to the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh whenever we've had bilateral issues with them.

Grow in industries they already dominant. Stop focusing on being street smart and start being honest self for your growth. Just start businesses that are cheaper to work with and have higher quality than India. Start export businesses of everything. Whichever thing you can import from china find a way to manufacture it locally and export it to global market while making sure the cost to customer is less than India. 
 Other day I was wondering if we could create a SpaceX like org in Pakistan just to counter India. A private entity that is solely focused on development of space tech. 
 Similarly, how many startups are there in Pakistan that are focused on AI. I know of only one, my employer but they are operating out of Dubai. Start developing AI software.

 I have a tutorial site that is used by US computer science students to learn from. You can create similar products. If someone is doctor, why the fuck aren't you in YouTube? If someone is a lawyer, why are you not on YouTube discussing past cases? If someone is in government sector with special domain about public why aren't you on YouTube educating people about processes of your department. If you are investor, why aren't you teaching basics of investment in Pakistan market. If you are anyone anywhere why aren't you teaching it to others? Millions are busy just making TikTok videos, watching porn and fighting over petty issues.
We are 200k+ people here, if we just create about what we know on platforms we access we will add wood to fire that is being watered on. One tutorial a month about your specialty is all that is needed to create a momentum that destroys years of work put in my indian government.

Reddit,Only serious replies. What did we get right in Pakistan?,ThinkingThinker007,"1- There is no other country in the world, including other Muslim majority countries, where Muslim Ulema have as much freedom to speak as in Pakistan. From criticism of state policies, to state laws has all been done by the Ulema with far more freedom in Pakistan than what is possible anywhere else. 
2- Preservation and celebration of the legacy of the Mughal empire would not have been possible without the creation of Pakistan. The idea that Muslims once ruled from Afghanistan to Kashmir to Assam to Bengal while covering the Deccan plateau hence making up nearly 23% of world population would have been totally corrupted and tarnished. Names like Babar, Akbar, Humaiyoun, Aurangzeb, Tipu, etc. would no longer be household names of choice for so many parents in the 21st century. 
3- Muslims of the areas making up today’s Pakistan would have been mostly still living in destitute poverty despite being in numerical majority. The reason is that Muslims of these areas economically had no standing after the collapse of the Mughal empire until the partition. For example, Lahore’s Anarkali bazar, and other business and land ownership was almost entirely in the hands of Hindus and Sikhs. 
4- Without Pakistan, Muslims of the subcontinent would be behind in human development even compared to Dalits as has happened with Muslims who remained in India after the partition. Many Muslims from the sub-continent who live in Western countries today would have never reached those countries without their previous generation moving to Muslim-majority countries a generation earlier first to break the vicious cycle of poverty. 
5- Only one type of Muslim would have been accepted as a first class citizen of united India. That type would be that of former Indian President Abdul Kalam. The things Pakistanis don’t even think about and take for granted such as having a city named Islamabad would not have been possible. 
6- Without Pakistan, there would have been no Muslim country with nuclear weapons. 
7- Without Pakistan, there would have been no Muslim country with a military in the top 10 of Global Firepower ranking. 
8- Without Pakistan, even protesting against Israeli war on Palestinians, America’s war on Afghanistan and Iraq, etc. would have been impossible for the muslims of the subcontinent, let alone openly supporting the national ambitions of Palestinians, Iraqis, Afghans, Syrians, etc. at international forums. No one would be ringing alarm bells on international forums for Muslims of the subcontinent before, during and after riots and calls for genocide of Muslims. 
9- Without Pakistan, it would have become far more challenging to preserve and practice Islam in the Indian subcontinent. Instead of the Muslim Ulema, Hindu judges would be deciding on what is permissible and what is not, as has happened in case of triple-talaaq, wearing burkas, wearing scarves, eating beef, and many issues pertaining to Muslims as is described in Uniform Civil code. Giving azan on loudspeaker 5 times a day, every day would be controversial at best or would be banned in many places at worst. Revocation of Citizenship of any Muslim could have been possible with laws such as NRC and CAA. 
10- Last but not the least, the vast majority of Muslim men like myself who actively participate in politics, protests, and movements against their own establishment would be in jail in undivided India. 
Despite lots of issues and problems, Pakistan is a great blessing of Allah for the Muslims of the subcontinent who have a future in Pakistan. The only downside of the creation of Pakistan was that Muslims who stayed behind in India became leaderless and directionless after partition due to political brain drain as all politically savvy leaders moved to Pakistan.",6 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/15r3gmz/only_serious_replies_what_did_we_get_right_in/

 As for dowry, when it comes from the groom’s side, it’s called bari. I’m not sure if every family follows this, but in mine it’s a tradition that the groom prepares the bari for the bride. 
 But the worst part of both dowry and bari, in my opinion, is the way they’re displayed.

Reddit,Do any of the men here cook? (vent),Argentum09,"I'm a guy and haven't entered my twenties, and I can cook pretty much all the dishes we have in Karachi on a regular basis. My sisters always used to bicker with each other when I had to ask them to prepare the simplest tea for me when I was little, so I got tired of it and started doing it on my own. 
 I tried to always be mindful of the women in my household and how hard they were working. My mom would be sweating buckets in the morning, preparing breakfast for me, and I always appreciated the food. In hindsight, I should've made her sit down and relax, but as a child, I didn't know what to tell her except feel imdebted to her. 
 I did do the dishes every now and then, and usually, they were my own. My mom made me clean the tables and stuff, so I guess I was always helping out with those things, but at the end of the day, it wasn't entirely all my responsibility. I just did it because it would make everyone else's lives easier. The last thing I want is to be a burden. 
 Though I only learned cooking when I got tired of restaurant food and wanted my mom's cooking. My logic was that I am the same blood, so I should be able to make things like she used to. 
 Now she has passed on, and my sisters have moved out.
I'm on my own and occasionally cook for my father and myself as well. 
 Oh, and I never ""helped out"" because it never felt appropriate cramming two angry people in a kitchen [the heat gets to you]. I usually left whoever was cooking all alone so they could do it. Of course, I was often charged with groceries, so that's about all I could do.

We both work, r busy etc, it's not something u push onto the person at once. Some days u purposely sleep in or delay breakfast or u leave the house for work before he's awake and he's left with no option but to cook. 
 He started doing this after moving to the west with me. I was raised in the west. My life has always been middle class and we do not hve any extra chef services etc. I knw u asked abt pk born ppl, so tats him. 
 The guy use to nvr pick up the cup and take it to the sink, now he takes everything off the dinner table to the sink. He cooks chicken bacon, nuggets etc. Nothing frm scratch yet but hey he feeds himself wen he needs to. I do spend a lot of hrs a day cooking, however there will be some form of meal where ei do not make it and he makes it instead for himself, uts usually breakfast.

 For example my husband will see tat I'm rlly busy cooking and then it takes away time tat I get to spend with him, tats where he steps in so tat we spend more time together nd I can be less tired, as I also put in effort in other areas of life.

Reddit,Do any of the men here cook? (vent),homesicklarki,"You could simplify it down to village vs city for sure. 
In my experience Punjabi culture is the most patriarchal and a high literacy rate doesn’t seem to make a difference. Look up Mirpuri immigrants to the UK. People in Karachi tend to be a little more tolerant all around - I blame diversity for it. Karachi is a melting pot so there’s people of all backgrounds you’re interacting with - I think it opens up people’s world views.  
 But patriarchy runs deep in the cities here too. I know plenty of educated “modern” households in Karachi or Lahore or Islamabad where women are essentially like hired help. In the end it really comes down to each household’s specific dynamics - you’ll hear men say “I cook because I enjoy it” but never “I cook because I have to”, vs women and girls regardless of whether they enjoy, are expected to cook.  
 I really despise cooking, I don’t do it. I didn’t do it when I lived alone in the States and I don’t do it after I got married in Pakistan. But I remember how my mother would constantly tell my then future mother in law that I don’t know how to cook and that I won’t be cooking at all during the e engagement period. There was an expectation “koi baat nahi baad mai seekh le gi” and it took a while for them to fully realize that it’s just not gonna happen. I’m lucky though, my in laws are chill my husband is not patriarchal at all. We split household chores and hire help for the cooking.

Even in the comments you'll see people mentioning they know how to cook or they're the back up in case women are tired (cue: in case women are tired which women are the primary worker)
You'll also see people mentioning we ""help"". No chores aren't supposed to be help, cooking is not supposed to be a ""help"", so if they're saying they ""help"", it means women are working in the house.

Mostly we have a maid but at the very least I can make myself a meal, B/L/D, mom taught me as much. At the same time my mom cooks 99% of the time, dad usually comes back home at 9. I wouldn't mind coming back home and making myself a meal but the fact that I have a partner at home that will welcome me with a warm meal is a luxury few get to experience. Don't get me wrong, cleaning up after your brothers is no way to raise a daughter or a son, since it does not teach them responsibility and teaches you to compensate for their lack of input.   
 I am the eldest of 3, 2 younger sisters. While on 1 hand I can 'exercise' my right as the elder brother to do my bidding(lol), it goes both ways. I drive them to school/events/food. I don't mind scooping out rice, or handing them glass of water. I am there to take care of them. Those are the values I was taught growing up, They are still young and will hopefully pull their weight as they grow up.   
 As for the cultural/traditional view on gender roles, there is nothing wrong with learning how to cook/clean etc. These are important life skills. There is a degree of prejudice but that stems from the fact that mothers are homemakers, we no longer live simple lives. Double incomes are usually required to have a sustainable home, which means a lot of women have transitioned into a workplace.

Reddit,Do any of the men here cook? (vent),pitch-fork,"Yeah it's definitely Pakistan culture. It's the same w my dad, brother, and other male relatives. A few days ago my cousin (45F) ranted to me about her sons (20M and 16M) throwing wrappers and boxes behind their bed after eating, even though the dustbin is right beside them. She went on to say, ""It's not their fault, they always saw their dad do the same."" She has to clean the space behind their bed periodically, bcs they don't bother doing so.  
 However, a lot of my male friends do cook, and I feel it's because gender role enforcement isn't rlly entrenched that strongly in my age group, so they themselves question this practice of women picking up after men and serving them. One of my guy friends (23M) loves to cook and happily shares a lot about his experiments with food. Another one (22M) cooked breakfast for me when I rushed to his place to be able to attend an online class since my internet wasn't working, so that I wouldn't have to take class on an empty stomach. Another (25M) purposely asked his mom why she always asked his sister to make chai or wash the dishes and never him, and insisted that she ask him sometimes, and now he regularly makes chai for his family after dinner. In my boyfriend's (21M) household, its the norm for everyone to wash their plate and glass by themselves after they're done eating. His dad (50 something) used to cook often when he had a job, and after his retirement he now cooks dinner regularly to give his wife a break. My point of giving these examples is, the sane ones are out there, so do whatever you can to surround yourself with them.

Biryani is of many types. It's the same issue with the modern pizza. I think the person who made that comment was going for technicalities. Like, if this guy is claiming that since Pakistani land was once Indian land, therefore everything came from India. So by that logic, we can divide cuisine by where it was made, leading to your revelation about biryani, or by faith (anything made by a South Asian Muslim should go to Pakistan then further divided between Pakistan and Bangladesh since they also split from us later.

You're doing the same thing as those two commenters. Stop focussing too much on pointless technicalities. 
 As for the pizza example. The origin is Italian but the current cheese and topping affair is American, specifically from war times. If we're going to get technical, anytime you put something on flatbread alongside a fat, you're making a pizza. A paratha brushed with ghee and sprinkled sugar on top? Pizza. 
 So, as I mentioned. It's better to ignore the semantics. If you see a dish with South Asian origins like biryani or nihari or chapli kabab, both Pakistani and Indians should be allowed to call them theirs since both have variations of the recipes and both carry the same names in both countries.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/t4x7rs/pakistan_embassy_in_ukraine_giving_shelter_and/

Reddit,[MEGATHREAD] - Coronavirus Outbreak,kalakawa,"Post not accepted- Commenting here:- 
 Corona and Small businesses: 
 I run a medium size restaurant business which employees a 150 people.  
 My total payroll is pretty high and payroll as a percentage of my sales is usually around 25% in pre corona days. Over the last two weeks sales have fallen to a point that now payroll is over 67% of sales, I fear that this is only the beginning and as I’m forced to close all my outlets this will only get worse. To the point where I will be burning cash on overheads till this passes over. My thought is this, if this thing lingers on, I will burn cash with my reserves for the next three months, post which I’ll be bankrupt and be forced to shut down.  
 I have the following options.  
 1)  Shut down business completely,let go of my employees, stop paying utilities and rent and restart when this passes over by preserving cash right now. This way my employees will have a job in the long run. 
 2) Restructure the business to just do deliveries and takeaway. While this sounds easy and a no brainier. Delivery sales can never come to a point where they cover my current overheads. To do this effectively I will have to also let go of 50% of redundant workforce ( for eg dishwashers that aren’t required in a delivery only mode etc..), aggressively re-negotiate my rental agreements and trim down my electricity usage to a bare minimum. 
 These are the logical options. However I love my employees. I have the lowest employee turnover in the industry and I hate to let them go or suffer. Because I know that with the current situation it’s not like they can find jobs elsewhere. What I’m also thinking is a third option.  
 3) Asking all of my employees that are out of city, to go back to their villages and towns where I know they can find food and shelter with their families. Will deposit 25% of their salaries to these guys over the course of corona through bank transfer. 
The rest of the redundant work force which I don’t need now and who live in the city, I’m thinking of giving ration boxes on a monthly basis till this blows over, this can only work if the government gives the whole country a utility bill break for the next month. For my employees living in the city, 40-60% of their salaries go towards paying utility bills. 
The employees that are left and are working are now offered a 50% pay reduction.( This they have accepted)
I will still be burning cash because sales will be negligible but this way I can sustain for the next 6 months.  
 This is what I’ve thought till now. My landlords aren’t budging on rent but I feel they will give in once they realise the severity of the situation in the coming weeks. I’m personally not taking any money out of the business till this blows over and will be living on my personal reserves.  
 What do you guys think? 
 Hopefully someone from PTI reads this and decides on giving some utility relief to the people of Pakistan.",9 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/fi3an3/megathread_coronavirus_outbreak/

 kpk into two like you did and I agree with gilgit thought I would rather it be a full province along with azad kashmir punjab 5 provinces one for each river bhawalpur for south east below sutluj, dera ghazi khan for west from kabul river, jehlum for west of the jehlum multan for between sutluj and ravi with lahore being a karachi type free city so they develope using their own money and this province doesnt leech off them the land between ravi and jehlum our new heartland with gujranwala being capital",43 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1fevs83/alternate_provincial_scheme_i_made_because_i_was/
Reddit,"Alternate provincial scheme I made because I was bored in class. Not really meant to be a serious proposal, just food for thought. Dark green are provinces, light green are territories",ReaperPlaysYT,"for some reason i didnt get your messege on reddit notification but here I am 
 the thing about divion along ethnic lines is that we dont get a issue where people say we are under represented or lets consider a scenario group A is split into lets say 3 provinces when we divide punjab which leads to them being under represented in punjab so why not just divide a province along them ? and not for a low 10 mil people but for people in 20 or 18 mil and above 
 like the brahui in balochistan get kalat while baloch get makran upto chagi because they are a majority the hindhko get their part of kpk and there is a baloch or someother despora in central sindh which they should get 
 for karachi I believe it should be done for all major cities until we are a trilian dollar economy when they can rejoin EXCEPT KARACHI these include lahore, gujranwala, karachi itself, sialkot",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1fevs83/alternate_provincial_scheme_i_made_because_i_was/

Reddit,Eating Alone at a Restaurant in Pakistan.,smoshxshakira,"i did it last year very spontaneously. planned it out the night before, took an emergency half day leave from work, took the bus and chose the wall-facing table. most comfy meal i've ever had, took my time to savour the food and scrolled memes side by side xd so i'd say ABSOLUTELY go for it 
 this was a fine dining restaurant, so no one bothered at all. and honestly even in other places too, u often just feel like it because you fall in someone's line of vision where they cant help but look at you when they look around. and being a male i dont think you'll be bothered as much as females do sometimes (often guys tried to be friendly to me at kfc even though i was closed off and chose the solo stool seating) 
 i'd often do it at my uni too. chose a far off ground, bought biryani or some other comfort food and ate in silence in the sun while being surrounded by freaks xd i have close friends and fam but even still i prefer being alone and sitting by myself sometimes. i have grown up exactly like this and have learned to just ignore the judgement and plainly state that i like being alone. so just do you and raat gai baat gai everything :3",4 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1icttc5/eating_alone_at_a_restaurant_in_pakistan/

Reddit,Eating Alone at a Restaurant in Pakistan.,aeoveu,"I've eaten alone before (I'm not an introvert, I just happened to eat alone because friends weren't around, or because I was just too damn hungry). 
 Enter a restaurant, tell them it's just you (they'll probably seat you on a table for 2), order, and to keep yourself busy during the waiting time, use your phone (don't play games though; that's just immature - you're better off reading things). 
 People do judge - but if you go in with a poise and purpose, you somehow drown those judgy feelings. 
 You can also do this as an alternative (if you have a car): order a takeaway, go to your car, eat in peace (and turn on the radio). I used to have my lunch time like this cause I didn't want to be in my office building because it's my lunch time).

 First of all i am afraid if i go out the first thing thats gonna happen is ill be robbed. I won't have any transport left and if that never happened if i crashed i would end up dying because yeah the ambulance never comes here and all people do is film the tits out of your accident. 
 
 2.For me there isn't much do here alright except looking at stuff and where i live there isn't much to look at. 
 3.I don't mind reading books or going to a decent enough bookstore to just spend the time even if i don't buy much. There are no Chess clubs people are just robots moving on their bikes that's all i see as far as the food is concerned yeah im more interested in learning the skill at my kitchen's disposal.  
 4.And as you can tell i have no friends, now most people think its something of a flex or like its something to be proud of, well you can go f*ck yourselves because i have been dying for friends literally I'd rather be out riding with my friends than be spending all day on the internet playing chess with people i dont even know and oh yeah i cant read much cuz i can't buy books in the first place. 
 
 I don't go to school , I am too old for university i am unemployed and that leaves me with no human interaction at all. 
 
 6.The cops, i dont know if they will shoot me if i go out the can't trust the cops or should i say the entire police department one bit, I don't know when they will stop me and shoot the tits out of me. 
 7.Yeah, fuck this country for ruining my life and all the experiences i could have had and the friendships i could have had for creating a good enough education system for me to be studying in some university right now for me to be living a fucking life man, Like imagine a 35 year old man who can't even buy a fucking cycle and lives on his parents money.

Reddit,Why do most Pakistani lie?,Haseeb_mjk,"Lying isn’t unique to Pakistanis—people from all cultures do it for various reasons. However, in the cases you’ve described, there are a few cultural and social factors that might contribute to this behavior: 
 Desire for Social Status (Izzat) & Face-Saving 
 In South Asian culture, personal and family honor (izzat) is highly valued. When someone moves to a foreign country and doesn’t achieve the success they (or their family) expected, they may exaggerate their accomplishments to maintain their dignity in social circles. 
 Storytelling & Embellishment 
 Many Pakistanis grow up in environments where storytelling is a strong part of the culture. Sometimes, stories get exaggerated over time, almost as a subconscious habit, to make them more interesting or impressive. 
 Insecurity & Competition 
 For some immigrants, the pressure to ""make it"" in the West can be overwhelming. If they feel they haven't achieved enough, they may fabricate success stories to avoid feeling inferior or to impress others. 
 Adaptation & Survival Tactics 
 When people migrate, they often struggle with identity and status. Some might fabricate credentials or experiences to fit into new environments where professional backgrounds are not easily verifiable. 
 Overcompensation for Hardships 
 Many Pakistanis leave their country for better opportunities, often facing financial struggles and job downgrades. Instead of admitting hardships, they may lie to project a more successful image to maintain self-respect. 
 Your experiences suggest a pattern of small, often unnecessary lies. It’s likely that these individuals feel the need to embellish their stories to either impress others or cope with their reality. Of course, not all Pakistanis are like this—just like not all Americans, Europeans, or any other group are habitual liars. But in the immigrant experience, especially in communities where social status is deeply ingrained, it’s a behavior that sometimes emerges. 
 (Hope you got your answer! At the end of the day, lying or exaggerating isn’t something exclusive to Pakistanis—it’s a common human trait found across cultures. Some do it for status, some for attention, and some just out of habit. You've just happened to run into a few and you say Pakistanis like every paksitani is kinda that don't generalize and im sure you stuck some paksitanis who are very cool and good)",5 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1jooo2d/why_do_most_pakistani_lie/

 Not everyone of course, but many people are embarrassed of who they truly are, and lie to hype themselves up. That way others look up to them, and they also start to believe a false reality.   
 My mom also once gave an analogy of two pots (idk why she chose pots lmao). One pot is full of coins. When you add to this pot, it doesn't make much noise, since its full. The other pot has nothing, absolutely no coins. When you add one coin to this pot it is loud and makes noise, as it's empty. She compared this to the nature of people.

Reddit,Why's it so common to love other people's children but not your own?,Ok_Discussion_122,"This is so interesting. I think my parents were emotionally available and healthy. So there was a good balance of prioritising us vs cousins. Most of my traumas come from my uncle/aunt and their kids (my cousins). The only family I was super attached to and respected and stuff. They were obsessed with their children to an extent that they would put me and my siblings down all the time. Their kids even though much younger than us knew this and would manipulate their parents by telling lies. The parents would scream and even raise hands at us because their children could not lie. Their argument: children don’t lie. I was also a child but never considered one. When my mother saw what was happening (which was much later because these conniving people did most things in her absence), she started creating boundaries or helped us create ours but the damage was done. 
 I still remember to this day how I was 12 and made to baby sit 7 kids for days at a time. Making their food, feeding them, showering them, changing nappies and not being able to do it proper obviously because I was a kid. Only to be screamed at later. Because when the mother came back home from spending the whole day outside shopping, she saw her babies crying and that only meant one thing: that I was horrible to their kids. And yet, they would leave the kids with me again the next day. I wish I could go back and tell that 12 year old, she could say no. I had no idea the option existed.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ifvdg4/whys_it_so_common_to_love_other_peoples_children/
Reddit,Why's it so common to love other people's children but not your own?,AmmaAffaaa,"Imagine, you are very hungry but are not a very good cook, or fond of cooking or are too busy to cook. 
 What would you prefer? Eating already cooked excellent food or cooking from the scratch? What if you are forced to cook from the scratch, would you feel good? Better than if you were eating the already cooked delicious food? No, right?  
 Similarly, in our society, people get married and become parents not because they love each other and children but because it's the norm. 
 You can hardly expect positive, mature and loving parents, when (on top of a regressive, negative and costly society that causes depression and chaos) reponsibility of needy, whiny children is thrust upon them.  
 My father proudly says the Punjabi proverb ""Asal nalu sood pyara"", that you love your grandchildren more than your own children. And he acts on that without any guilt, as if it's an accepted universal truth.  
 Now he has love, attention and time for his grandchildren. When he had none for us, just his job and tv. This forced our mostly sensible mother to be an almost single parent. Adding more pressure to already depressing reality.  
 My mother used to be a super strict parent to us, in terms of manners and studies. A toe out of line, even accidental, resulted in tight slap to face. All while she was the epitome of cool and lovely aunt to her neices and nephews.  
 Now, she never hits her grandchildren and advices us to not burden them with too much studying. Let them enjoy life, but with the needed manners and discipline.  
 I also observed how her parenting changed from her eldest child, a daughter till her youngest, me, also a daughter. My sister used to be questioned on her clothing to trips in uni etc, while I was encouraged to go on trips and make new friends in uni (I am an extreme introvert).  
 I have also observed, how I love my neices and nephews to death. It hurt me when they cry and are disciplined by their parents (that's my trauma speaking). They come to me for solace and I shower love on them (without spoiling them, mind you), and tell them how discipline is also important.  
 Because it's the duty of their parents to teach them their own values strictly while it's mine to gently teach them with love. The children are the parents' reponsibilities at the end of the day.  
 I also know when I will have children of my own, I will be much harder on them than my own neices and nephews. And my siblings would shower them with more outright and leninet love than their own children.  
 Because, when you are solely resposible for the wellbeing of a child, especially your own, there can be no failings. Especially in our culture which gives no space for failure, of both the child and the parent.  
 While the other relations be it grandparents, or aunt and uncle are there just to shower love, not to take responsibility at the end of the day.  
 This is all very natural, BUT problems come when people are abusive and toxic and transfer their own traumas to the next generation.  
 It comes out as form of almost hate for their own children and rotten spoiling of others' children. Both wrong. There should be a middle ground of love and discipline for every child.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ifvdg4/whys_it_so_common_to_love_other_peoples_children/

Reddit,Who is keeping OPTP in business?,Adminisitrator,"well you asked for entree charging more than optp and i provided. 
 If they were over charging and ppl didn't find value for money, they would gone out of business long ago. You have ppl in this very thread praising them for their taste. Just because you dont find value for money doesn't mean rest have to boycott. From the list you provided, i've only tried daily deli and i didn't like it taste. To me its not value for money as its too bland and generic, so even paying 660 to deli is throwing away money away for me - but that doesn't mean i have to ask everyone to boycott it (or to use your words ""point out stupidity""). They serve a different customer base. 
 At the end of day it doesn't matter if you can make a spreadsheet of 100 more restaurants selling burgers for less than half of OPTP.

 They charge X amount, people are willing to pay that, that’s how a free market works.  
 OPTP has been in the market for nearly 2 decades now, they’ve created a brand that resonates well with people. I was a teenager when one of the first branches opened in Isb, I’m 37 now, the brand evokes nostalgia. Yes I could similar order food for less but sometimes I just want OPTP, the same goes for many other people.  
 Look at Hardees, a beef meal is around 2500. Yes it’s an international brand but that’s ridiculous pricing. People still eat there. Mc Donald’s ain’t cheap either.

 For example, if a privately owned business in Pakistan denies entry to women wearing shorts, many defend it by saying, “It’s their place, their rules,” or claim it’s against our culture. But what if, in Europe, a business refused service to someone with a beard or wearing traditional clothing? Or if a government denied a passport based on someone’s conservative appearance?

 It's not just Pakistan, it's also North India where rice consumption is very low compared to South India and Bangladesh. 
 There are multiple factors, but the most prominent one is the policies put in place by the British rule. The Mughals were fans of rice and they were the ones who popularized most of our favorite rice dishes (kheer, biryani, pulao/pulaf). But the British saw more ROI from rice export so in the regions they selected for mass-scale rice farming, rice consumption counter-intuitively went down and wheat consumption increased.

 That's not to say other cities in the UK don't have bad Pakistanis at all. They certainly do. But standards in Birmingham seem to have dropped quicker than any other area. This is due partly to the Birmingham city council being incompetent and going bankrupt - where public services are now neglected. As a result, all communities are declining in the city - yet the Pakistanis moreso are dropping at an alarming rate. There is definitely something inherit in our culture where we don't respect rules and standards

Reddit,We are one of the largest government donors to the WFP,DarkEvader,"No, he’s not right and you’re being pedantic. He’s dismissing the entire post as ‘fake news’ without even checking the attached image and source, both of which clearly state the statistics are from 2024. The title isn’t misleading, because the 2025 rankings won’t be finalised until the year ends and are therefore in flux. Data from an incomplete year can’t be treated as definitive unless compared to equivalent data from the same point in previous years (quarterly or biannual metrics) which we don’t currently have.  In development work, it’s standard practice to reference the most recently completed year when discussing current data. You could say ‘Country X’ is the nth largest contributor to WFP in 2025 based on whatever they’re ranked right now and be completely wrong given there’s still four months left in 2025. Unfortunately, there’s nothing that can be said for 2025 right now, especially given that one-third of annual giving occurs in December alone.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1mi4mfm/we_are_one_of_the_largest_government_donors_to/

 >I know how to deal with any internal clashes 
 (Reddit will hate me for it but) IMO best way to deal with female related issues of your home is for the eldest man in the house (not family) to decide clashes between them (& if necessary dictate it to them, women will naturally hate this, but remember your wife is your main responsibility) 
 You cannot let your relatives deal your wife badly or treat her unwell, while at the same time you have to ensure the respect and care of your mother, & on top of that, the love, care & even marriage of your sisters 
 its a delicate balance finer than pul e sirat itself

Reddit,Can I marry without spending a fortune?,chota-kaka,"There are three elements of a marriage in Islam:
1. Sending marriage proposal to the girl's home.
2. Nikah 
3. Waleema 
 Everything else that we do are customs and traditions, some from Hinduism. Islam does not object to these customs and traditions as long as:
1. The customs and traditions are within reasonable limits.
2. Are not explicitly linked to religious rituals of other religions. 
 As per Islam, the man sends proposal to the girl's home. If the proposal is accepted, then they proceed with the nikah.  
 The nikah can be performed at home or in the masjid. In Islam, there is no concept of clergy (Maulvi). Every adult Muslim should know the words to be said during a nikah. However, we being lazy have outsourced this and many other duties to Maulvis. Since we have become dependent on them, they blackmail us. Anyways, if you do not know the words, you will have to seek the help of a Maulvi. Technically only the girl, her wali (if it is her first time or she is not independent), the guy and witnesses are required for the nikah. However, our social norms dictate that the parents and siblings of both the boy and the girl attend the nikah along with other close relatives. 
 After nikah for all practical purposes, the bride and groom are husband and wife. Baraat and rukhsati are just social customs.  
 The Haq mehr is the girls right (within reasonable limits) and is to be given to the girl by the groom. The bride has the right to waive it if she so desires. However not giving Haq mehr to the wife is considered a sin. 
 Dowry (jahez) is a custom adopted from the Hindus and is discouraged especially if it is demanded by the groom or his family. However the bride's family may give her gifts.  
 After nikah, waleema is compulsory. The marriage does not have to be consummated in order to have a waleema (contrary to what our Maulvis claim). Waleema is a party given by the groom to announce his marriage to family and friends. Since it is obligatory on the groom, its expenses are not to be shared by the bride or her family. The waleema does not even have to be a meal and can be just a cup of tea offered to the guests. 
A waleema is held so that the groom introduces his wife so that the family and friends honour her as his wife. A waleema also ensures that the nikah is not posheeda (hidden) to protect the rights of the bride and any children they may have. Hidden nikkah can be a problem if the husband divorces her. Also without proof of a nikah, the paternity of the children is not certain. Hidden nikah also causes problems in cases of inheritance.

Reddit,Why are Pakistan's Neighbours More Successful?,TerryMakichoott,"Yep I had one lie through his teeth about so many things related to this country when I was getting myself involved in it.  Guy barely knew me but wanted me and my wife to move to his town and then told me living in Pakistan as a foreigner is legally impossible and that they won't give me a POC.  I applied and got it in 2 weeks.  This guy tries to poison my relationship with my new family during my FILs cancer.  He told me that he didn't want me coming back to Pakistan during his illness (FIL and I had a language barrier but loved each other nonetheless).  Then he died and he called my wife and my wife asks why I didn't come and he said ""this is how Americans are, they don't care about family"".  He calls me 3 years later after I forbade my wife from talking to him again after I tell her he told me that my FIL told him not to come even to say goodbye.  He cuts me off in typical Pakistani uncle fashion saying ""it's impossible to live in Pakistan as a foreigner"" and I say ""uhhhh I've been here 3 years, they gave me the POC (which he told me that they won't give)"" and he just answers ""awwwwww....."".  He starts talking down on Pakistanis this time to me, I mean yeah we all know this place has it's issues but I'm not casting blame on every single person trapped in this green passport prison.  He starts talking shit about my wife's studies and wanting to study abroad and he says ""she needs to know that the education system here is different than Pakistan and it's difficult to get into university here (followed by a bragging session about his son going to Harvard)"" and my wife while the call is muted says ""he thinks I'm some billo rani who lives in the clouds thinking America will hand her everything on a silver plate"".  My wife literally discovered a new genetic disease during her post grad studies here in Pakistan... 
 This is the same dude that invited me to his house just to show off his valuables (idk what the obsession with showing off is here but it's dangerous and especially in the US where you don't have a fortress of walls and societies to protect you, he didn't know me at all and showed me things worth tens of thousands, and he gave me his work schedule and when he sends his wife to the spa schedule, If I were a crackhead his house would've been empty that week).",5 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1m2xzq0/why_are_pakistans_neighbours_more_successful/

Reddit,Why are Pakistan's Neighbours More Successful?,TerryMakichoott,"I'm just a foreigner living here so this is my observation. 
 The political system here was designed for British people to profit and then when they left nothing changed except the same system being handed over to brown people.  Its not saying it could've worked and been successful but multiple other factors came into play.  Basically the way the system is set up, being honest gets you punished.  If you become a filer for instance, you pay a large chunk of your income for nothing while the people in power vote for more benefits for themselves and then you don't even get roads (ie Karachi).  The system is set up to benefit the dishonest and corrupt people. 
 Also the quota system.  My father in law was a cop.  Mid ranking.  He literally had to read all documents for his SHO because the SHO was illiterate.  He got his job on quota alone.  How can someone who can't even read effectively lead a police station? 
 Also the culture is regressive and a lot of it goes against Islam but molvis will somehow make it Islamic just to appease their followers (while plundering them too, I honestly believe alot of these molvis are atheists and just use religion as a cover to make money, it's a good grift, look at how rich the prosperity gospel preachers in the US have made doing their grift).  People blame Islam, but Islam isn't the problem, the cultural deviant nationalist hybrid of Islam is the problem.  Also ethno nationalism and tribalism.  I'm convinced if Pakistan hadn't been created all the Muslims would be more united than they are now (not saying creating Pakistan was a mistake, I think it was necessary, but it let ethnonationalism get out of hand).  It's led to kufri communist groups like BLA and Sindhudesh folks wanting to harm their fellow Muslims based on what language they speak. 
 Society itself is corrupt too.  Everyone here has a story of being scammed in some very evil way.  Having important documents held hostage for bribes etc.  Society has to change before anything can progress",5 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1m2xzq0/why_are_pakistans_neighbours_more_successful/

 We had a really rough start. No proper industrial factories, qualified personnel, and no leadership due to jinnahs and liaqat ali khans untimely death.  
 Moreover there was A LOT of unrest after the partition, followed by our wars with india and the loose ties and separation of Bangladesh. 
 We just kept getting Marshal law after marshal law. Even during times of economic growth power was centered towards some families which is still true today.  
 The constant interference of the military, appointing whoever it favours. The lack of stability, brain drain, and a lot of backward ideas and lack of education has prolly also contributed.",57 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1m2xzq0/why_are_pakistans_neighbours_more_successful/

 Come the 90s though, the government began systematically de-industrialising the country because of repeated MF conditions and selling out to foreign corporate interests. 2000s revived some of it back, but 08 onwards destroyed it again. 
 Other countries built basic industries, then built secondary industries on top of that, and tertiary industries on top of that. Pakistan hasn't moved past textiles and foodstuff.

Reddit,Why are Pakistan's Neighbours More Successful?,dadofwar93,"I generally don't comment on other countries's subs but this came on my feed so I'm just telling u one thing. Don't go on the figures that per capita gdp of India is low , it is low in the pov of a western market/expenses . The things are very expensive in the west and so their mean salary has to be high to live a basic life. Meanwhile things in India are very affordable so it doesn't require that much money to live a good life as in the west. 
 A packet of lays in America is around 250 Indian rupees but in India it's just for 20 Indian rupees, so the same luxury can be experienced in India with a lesser amount as things are not expensive. 
 10 million Indian rupees in the west is somewhat equal to 3 M Indian rupees in India with respect to expenses. I've many relatives in the west so I've this understanding of conversion.  
 So the middle class Indian on paper might not look that much rich because it's made with the pov of the west , but in India they are living a well equipped life. 
 So ur point that Indian middle class in not much better than urs is not correct.

 As far as your comment on Islam goes, whilst I am a strong proponent of secularism, Saudi, UAE, Jordan etc still have Islamic Sharia law actually harsher than Pakistan. We have more liberal laws despite the Islamic nature of our country (Rights for transgenders, abortions and interest based banking). The problem in this country is not really islam it is Populism and Corruption but it's worse than India or any country because of corruption as Populism alone isn't enough. (Like America is collapsing because it is going scarily in a similar direction to Pakistan with both Populism and Heavy Corruption disguised as ""Lobbying""). Recent war between the two countries did not really help either, as it made the deeply unpopular army very very favourable again. 
 We are and have always been victims of terrorism as well, which did not come from Islam actually but from geopolitical decisions by other countries such as Soviets and Americans fighting eachother. Destablizing Afghanistan and allowing terrorism to become rampant. It is a sad reality unfortunately. 
 In the end really, our politicians did chase money, but they weren't really in tune with the Religion of Islam to invest it back, knowing how well just like ALL RELIGIONS of the the world, Islam preachers people to not be corrupt.

Truth is some do make enough money from being an ""influencer"" to afford to genuinely eat constant luxury meals and go on holidays once a week. Most ""influencers"" however are in debt and are maintaining a mirage of success. The majority of ""influencing"" comes down to faking it until you make it. But most never make it.  
 Oh and influencing isn't a real job.

 وَاصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ ۖ وَلَا تَعْدُ عَيْنَاكَ عَنْهُمْ تُرِيدُ زِينَةَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَلَا تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُ فُرُطًا﴾
[ الكهف: 28] 
 English - Sahih International
18:28 And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect. 
 There's a huge difference between Instagram and reality. Our focus should be Akhirah and the lifestyles of others, no matter how desiring it looks shouldn't make us forget the difference between Halal and Haram.

Back then there was no such thing as ChatGPT so I would spend hours and days sometimes trying to solve simple programming problems. The setbacks were definitely frustrating at times. Also we would lose electricity in the middle of my projects due to load shedding and I would lose all my work.. sometimes internet would go down for days. Patience and consistency is key here. 
 Honestly I did not really feel like I was missing on a lot. They are a big enough agency to not have me worry about finding work and I would spend the next few years from 2017 - 2021 serving them until I got hired by another agency in San Francisco that would pay me even better. 
 Honestly, it wasn’t easy. I would basically spend the whole day working. For me there was no such thing as going outside or having much social life. I was determined pursuing my goals and trying to get my family out of debt. I would seek the help of Namaz for meditation and peace of mind. And to ask Allah to make it easier for me to achieve my goals. 
 Seriously, for the first few months to years try to put your focus in polishing your skills. Don’t be scared by the saturated markets and the amount of too many freelancers. If your work is good, people would want to work with you. Use LinkedIn to apply for jobs overseas once you’re at a good point and have a portfolio. That’s where I have the most luck these days. And is where I found my current job.

 Sure. yes, my parents protected me from this kind of filth and I am happy about what they did. Because almost all of my acquaintances who were fond of eating such garbage are either dead or still suffering from deadly diseases like Hepatitis etc.

Reddit,"For those of you who don’t fast, how do you handle that?",MrBarret63,"That is more like framing it in a negative sense.   
 I am not sure if you have seen western societies where people generally just totally do not ask about other peoples lives (unless they either of them explicitly allows). That results in people seeing each other but knowing nothing else about them (even less so then we already experience). 
 There should be limits to it and each has its own way. If you have a decent answer, then you should not have an issue of someone asking. Generally I think it goes something like since fasting is a farz (unless there is a legit reason) people are inquisitive kai Islam choor dya hai (i.e. bhaatak gaye hoo).

 I was on the train from fez to Marrakesh. I was travelling and on my period. In my cabin was a lovely father and young daughter. Her and I shared food for the first part of the journey. Along came a yappy older man. Really attacked me verbally and shouting at the father in Arabic about me and his daughter. I didn’t back down, he should have shame - he said he had many daughters. Then you know a woman has many reasons not to fast. Eventually a woman came and told him to back down and he found it funny saying in some countries they’ll lash you for eating publicly. I haven’t fasted now for 5 years due to pregnancy and breastfeeding. My mother cannot fast due to long term sickness and has to eat regularly. It’s a long train journey.

 It is compulsory that we fast in Ramadan unless we are going through medical issues. This is the theological point. If your personal views differ from it, then you can't claim you are religious, by logic, you wouldn't be.

Lastly, our bhunna qeema with mattar and gaajar is OG. But again, REDUCE THE OIL. The pulao/handi/qeema can easily be stored in freezer.  
 You can easily do 120g protein in 1750 calories. Heck I try to do around 160g in 1900 calories. If you feel like you’ve gone a couple of hundred calories above, just make sure you’re getting at least 10k steps in every day, which will boost your TDEE by 200-300 calories and you’ll for sure be in a deficit. However, the deficit shouldn’t be too aggressive unless you’re trying for cut. If body recomp, go for a moderate deficit (max 500). Slow but steady and you’ll put on muscle while losing fat.

Forget asking about someone's day, no please, no sorry, no thank you, no Allah hafiz, nothing. And when they ask them to do something, it's like they are commanding their slaves.  
 On the other hand there's no concept of customer service in this nation. Recently my mother called Ufone services and the dude was actively aggressive. Idgaf if you had a bad day, professionalism is about detaching yourself from your job. And my mother wasn't the one who gave you a bad day anyway, how dare you get aggressive with her.

Reddit,is pakistan really unsafe for women?,yaboisammie,"Don’t live there but from what I can tell during my visits which have been lengthy in the past and what I’ve heard from others, it really depends on the area. For example, the area my extended family lives in is not really for women and honestly, kabhi kabhi kuch log ladkon ko bhi nahin chorte so I get your father’s concern. Last time I went, my friends who have spent most of their lives in that area were telling me about sex trafficking and how dangerous it is for girls/women to go out and meet anyone, even friends which was why my mother was so reluctant to let me see my friend even though we’ve known each other for almost a decade atp (though as someone who also lives in an unsafe area in general, I get her concern) and it’s prob worse for us as expats as well. And idk about you/your age but I’m tiny, super weak and have a baby face on top of still having had braces atp so I looked even younger than I actually am which prob made me even more of a target or easier target to be abducted.  
 
  i’m always arguing that it’s literally 2025 and things have definitely changed in the world and it’s definitely safe for women to visit, plenty of women have visited and posted vlogs and all and they returned home safely 
 
 Unfortunately even in 2025, a lot of places are kinda stuck in the past and have not kept up w the rest of the world in terms of advancing and bettering themselves. I can’t speak for the women you’re talking about who’ve posted vlogs though I wouldn’t be surprised if they were white or even if they are desi, maybe they’re wealthier or from wealthier areas which may be safer.  
 
   i feel like according to his logic (that i strongly oppose), basically nowhere in the world is safe for women 
 
 I mean… tbf he does have a point lmao 😅 it mostly just comes down to which are safer or not as safe, I feel.  
 Idk how old you are but even if you’re older, I get why he’d still be concerned for your safety as a girl/woman, esp since expats tend not to know the area/be familiar w it if you are out and about on your own, unless you used to live there which isn’t the case for you. But I’m not sure why he wouldn’t be willing to go with you or send a male mahrem with you? And if you have relatives there to stay with, I’d be surprised if they expected or even let you go out on your own LMAO, I figure you’d always have at least one person w you at all times when going out 
 Not that it’s fair that a lot of us are expected by our families to “just wait til we are married” so we can do the stuff we wanna do w our future partners but hopefully atp you’ll be able to go 😭 idk if you’ll wanna live there once you ac see it but I’d defo suggest visiting for a longer period of time before deciding lol 
 It seems like your father is adamant about not coming himself though, did he maybe have bad experiences while living in Pakistan that he associates it with? And do you have brothers or mamu, chachu, tayas or anyone that could escort you? Or honestly your mother or any aunt might work at least so you’re not alone while traveling?

He likes to eat out a lot, which is pretty normal among teens. He does not like to go shopping or buy expensive things. He’s just a big eater. He’s a very low maintenance guy and does not have high food expectations like going to fancy restaurants or eating steak and 5 star meals. You can give him a shawarma, and he’s happy.

 My brother told me that when they would go out to the bazaars, if the bill was like 6-7k, then everyone would pitch in and pay like 500 rupees. So it wasn’t like she was paying for the entire bill for everyone.  
 The thing is why I’m mad is because a couple years back she would ask me to send her money for her college fees because she was broke and her parents were not paying for her. In 2021-2022 I sent her $3,000 CAD which is like 6 lakh for her fees and everything. Some time later I found out she was using it to fund her lifestyle and to take her friends out to eat and buy herself fancy clothes. My siblings called me an idiot and told me not to do it again. 
 Now I feel like she took advantage of me again because she knows how to play me to get money from me. Last time I never confronted her because I sent her the money for sake of Allah, so khair إنْ شَاءَ ٱللَّٰهُ. But, this time… she is accusing my brother of being a liar and saying he has no idea what 500 rupees are in Pakistan and my brother is mad. Now I’m stuck in the middle because I don’t know who to believe and I am trying to protect my brother too.

 Your brother eating out isn’t the concerning part in this post. For me it’s how unnecessarily close you are to your cousin that created this situation to begin with. Sharing bank accounts and auditing her is just a level I don’t think I have with anyone and I love a lot of people. For your Pakistani family you will also be the Canadian xyz (insert relationship). They see that you earn in CAD but completely miss that you live in CAD too. This is why it’s best to keep your personal finances a closely guarded secret especially in Pakistan.

She just scammed you out of about 55-60k of the 120k PKR you sent over. Probably to buy herself a fancy dress or a new phone etc lol 
 Your brother is right. And your cousin thinks nothing is available online to cross check and verify. Lol  bank fees in Pakistan are nominal, to actually encourage people to use online payments instead to cash. Tax on card/online transactions is 5% while in cash it's 18%. And for KFC and even all other restaurants, tax is often included in the total price quoted. 
 Sialkot is a part of Pakistan and a much much smaller city than Lahore or Khi and even Isb. Unless the delivery driver used a Limo every time to deliver, the delivery fee isn't more than 150 rupees. 
 Also KFC charges a flat delivery rate of 45 to 60 rupees depending on your location from their branch.  
 No bank charges 1k on a 5k transaction. Lol  she is lying 100% and there will be no point confronting her other can causing more issues in the family. You know you've been played. Consider it a lesson learnt. Never send her any more money and make sure you keep everything documented for any future BS coming your way because she will try to inflate the expenses even more and end up claiming they spent money out of pocket for your cousin. 😂",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1f6tgu5/is_it_possible_to_spend_120000_rupees_on_food/

 But do the math yourself. It’s possible to spend 120k in a few months. If someone is spending 2k daily, that’s easy math. Ask your brother if that’s true or not. A person can get fed up with KFC if they eat it for a week straight. 
 A jumbo roll paratha goes for 300-450. Shawarma from a stall costs 180-200, while Arabian shawarma can go for 800-1000. 
 KFC is one of the most affordable fast-food chains right now, even cheaper than Cheezious. Two people can fully enjoy a meal at KFC for a maximum of 3,000. It’s not possible for two people to eat more than that. At a fancy restaurant, the bill for two people can reach 4-5k, and at most, 7-8k. I’m talking about the rates in Islamabad, which are higher than in other cities. 
 If you consider car fuel, the minimum they could have spent is 1000-1500 per day. If they used a bike, it would be much cheaper. 
 A Foodpanda order for two people nowadays easily costs 2,000.

Reddit,"Is it possible to spend 120,000 rupees on food deliveries and outings in 2 months for one person in Sialkot?",hassanwattu,"I know this might be contrary to what you think, and what other people are saying on this thread, but let’s assume your brother ordered a Zinger Combo every night for two months. That’s 850 +  150 for delivery so, 1000 per order easy. Multiply that by 2, that makes it around 60,000 for 2 months.
Next question is was the food for one person every time? In joint families you sometimes have to order for at least the kids culturally. Adding just another sandwich per meal will take the total to 1500*60 that is 90000 rupees. Let’s say there were days your brother wanted to get take out twice a day. 
Now compare that with having the kiddo stay at a guest house or a hotel. Your costs could easily quadruple. You are discounting the money you saved on lodgings, fuel, socialisation etc. 
The margins are really low on eating the haram surplus they received. Air conditioning is also a cost that daily could set them back for months if not years in terms of tariff, and actual electricity cost. Maybe your khala is covering all her costs from there, but should have had the tact to give you a breakdown of all the costs, all.of.them, in detail. 
Anyways, a dude said should have given your brother the money. Or if you meant it as a vacation, should have set the right expectations. You said it yourself your khala isn’t well off.",-1 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1f6tgu5/is_it_possible_to_spend_120000_rupees_on_food/

But I can also maybe understand that overheads like increased electricity or other luxuries that came with accommodating a relatives kid from abroad will generate a spike in the normal monthly budget. Is that really something to ruin relations over? It’s 600cad total over 2 months.

 A fine dining experience with fancy Chinese, Steak or Korean Menu for 2 people ranges around 10-12k PKR. 
 KFC on the other hand is around 2000-2500 PKR.
McDonald's is effin expensive. I haven't had it since boycott and what not but it used to cost around 3-4k PKR when KFC could offer a more filling meal under 2-2.5k PKR. This is only my estimate for a family of 3. 
 Delivery fees is only around 150-200PKR per order. Rest you can tip if you want to. 
 A budget of 55k per month for food is more than enough. 
 Considering your relative ordered something for herself along with your brother, the bill would still be around 3-4k. 
 So 3k x 2 times a day = 6k daily.
6k x 30 days = 180,000 PKR 
 Tbh, I wasn't expecting such a high amount but I think if your brother ordered 2 times a day then it's pretty much possible that they did burn through it.",-3 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1f6tgu5/is_it_possible_to_spend_120000_rupees_on_food/

 Another thing that you said about our purchasing power being strong. It's a flawed argument. Let's consider a situation. A person earns 120k per month. After excluding all the expenses in this era, he/she would barely have the money to save for an emergency(in most cases people don't even have that) . So, according to data this person is earning more than the majority of Pakistan earns. Still he/she can't afford to go to a fast food chain with his family (2 kids & spouse). 
So, the meaning of this hypothetical situation is that majority of Pakistan isn't able to afford fast food. Hence, already small purchasing power even gets smaller.. So, if you think these franchise based companies are looting us & getting our dollars to support the war by paying taxes in Israel. So, it's such a minimum amount that if their is a increase in the sells of their fast food in China by a small margin then they would be able to compensate with that so-called ""loss"". Second, you also don't know how many dollars, and by which things are depleted in Pakistan. Most of things that deplete our dollars are intentional things.

 Coke isn't a fast food. Second, what I meant by ""working of boycott"" Was in stopping war or sending shock waves(at least little bit) in Israeli state.

Reddit,It's not cool anymore,M0nocleSargasm,"I don't think it's that simple, if you start out with a comparison, for them (Russia) between a direct confrontation with the US, and the depth and breadth of its (the US') arsenal and all of the various methods of delivery versus counter measures combined with its (the US') conventional abilities and the strength of its allies around the word versus what Ukraine's own system would look like if they had one.  Or even that of a country like Pakistan or Iran, to the extent they have a fully functioning one. I think there's a big difference there, a bit of a drop off, that alters the calculation a bit. These systems are an enormous liability, just in terms of what it takes to maintain them, keep them functional, and their delivery at the state of the art in terms of securing reliable control over them. 
 Remember, Putin is also the guy who put his own troops all around the radiation of Chernoybl, he's not at all deterred by the prospect of taking a large amount of casualties, of either troops or noncombatants; this is practically built into his plan of attrition and to maintain power. 
 So, you figure, Ukraine might get off one or two good two shots before Russia's counterstrike would effectively and immediately turn their whole country (Ukraine) into a huge DMZ thererby giving them a lot of strategic depth between themselves and the rest of NATO. Certainly not an ideal outcome, what they aim to effect; but perhaps not so far outside the scope of an acceptable risk, certainly not enough to completely incapacitate the regime.  No, if anything that would help to galvanize support from both within and without against Ukraine. 
 Now, if you were talking about American missiles, like what the US has positioned in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey; and with Ukraine as a NATO-member state; that's a whole other story.

 Now, let's take the example of Afghanistan. You pay taxes in Pakistan. They fund the government. These taxes were used to facilitate the k*llings of thousands of Afghans. Second, the influx of American dollars. Which were given to us for the sole purpose of supporting their military operations, both logistically & physically. These dollars have kept our economy running. We have sustained & thrived because of these dollars.  
 Then comes the internal issues. Like for example the k*lling and abduction done in Balochistan & Karachi.  
 What are the returns? Is Israel stopping its genocidal campaign? I don't think so. Most probably this is a peace deal is a face-saving peace deal. The deal which isn't strucked because of your boycott. Rather, because Trump wanted it for face-saving. 
 About the economic impact, so it's so minimal that they don't care. The decrease in share values for some boycotted companies is happening because of global consumer demand slowing down. Especially, in china.  
 Let's take the example of Russia. Even though Russia is sanctioned by the West, brands are still operating with different names and authorities. Israel isn't even sanctioned.  
 There are also millions of Afghans & Balochs that are requesting. Don't you care about them?  
 Lastly, the solution. If you are even looking for it. Can only be brought within the Western countries. By Public pressure. Not by boycotts. At least not by the boycotts of fast food chains.....

 Before going deep I want you to know that how you treat your body now will decide how your body will respond in future specifically in Pregnancy, Fighting a disease or in old age.  
 What you eat will either help your body to fight off diseases or help that disease.  
 Multiple studies found out that snacking between meals is one of the major causes of diabetes besides genetics. 
 This includes Tea with biscuits which is extremely common in India and Pakistan, Cake, Sugary drinks or any type of processed food.  
 The human liver works 24/7 and involved in around 500+ critical functions and when you eat something bad your liver and kidneys gets all the load dumped at because they have to take that crap out of your body you just ate to satisfy your craving. They may work flawlessly today but not forever, After a specific time they give up.  
 The point here is to respect your body.  
 Now the psychological perspective: 
 Remove all the triggers which may include delivery apps, restaurants sending your offer messages or emails, or you peeking at that food delivery app or watching Mukbang videos on Social media. Delete all that or at least limit it.  
 Replace that junk food with something healthy like a chocolate protein shake, dates, honey a milkshake. 
 DO NOT EAT ANYTHING SUGARY ON EMPTY STOMACH! It's gonna spike your sugar levels making you more hungry even when you're not actually hungry.

Reddit,Do you guys actually... like Pakistanis? I'm struggling these days,throwaway1991010,"I lived in the U.S. for 18 years but eventually returned to Pakistan because I grew tired of certain issues that you’ve mentioned. Let me share my perspective: 
 
 LGBTQ+ Community 
 
 While living in the West, I noticed that many people—both myself and even other Westerners—felt hesitant to express opinions about the LGBTQ+ community for fear of backlash. In many cases, their activism can come across as aggressive or exclusionary, with a tendency to focus solely on their rights while disregarding differing viewpoints. This behavior, in my experience, has created tensions in workplaces, schools, and communities. 
 
 Religious Divisions 
 
 Religious discord isn’t exclusive to Pakistan. In the U.S., for example, divisions among Christians are deeply entrenched. Protestants often criticize Catholics, Catholics clash with Baptists, Baptists oppose Adventists, and nearly everyone seems to dislike Jehovah’s Witnesses, who in turn see themselves as the purest. Harmony is rare, even in societies that pride themselves on tolerance. 
 
 Treatment of Women 
 
 I’ve personally witnessed numerous instances of violence against women in the U.S. Despite trying to intervene where I could, I was often outnumbered or overpowered. At work, when I stood up for a female subordinate facing mistreatment, it led to significant backlash from higher-ups. Ultimately, I had to leave the organization because of it. 
 
 Racism 
 
 As someone named Muhammad, I’ve faced racism far too often in the U.S. The number of incidents is too high to count, and the bias was evident in both subtle and overt ways. 
 Conclusion
The grass often seems greener on the other side, but more often than not, it’s just as barren there as it is here. Every society has its flaws, and sometimes what we imagine as a better alternative comes with its own unique set of challenges.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1gyobgb/do_you_guys_actually_like_pakistanis_im/
Reddit,Do you guys actually... like Pakistanis? I'm struggling these days,Kind_Leadership3079,"The things that bother me most about about Pakistanis is.. 
 1) The attitude of “entitlement. The people feel “entitled” to imposing their views/choices on others. People feel “entitled” to special treatment/help/sacrifices. As a result our people tend to overstep their boundaries in relationships in ways that are not Islamic. It creates tensions within families and the entitlement—abuse becomes a generational dilemma.  
 2) Oppressing women in every way. Women are judged harsher for divorce than a man. Women find it harder to get married or remarried if they are divorced or for “lesser” things that can mar their chances. Women being judged more severely than a man for the same sin that is decreed as haraam for both genders. Women expected to put up/compromise/sacrifice more. 
Women being the enemies of women. Mothers-in-law treating their daughters in law like crap. In his last sermon our Prophet Salallahu alayhi wa sallim said 3 (of multiple) times to “Be kind to the women”……maybe because he has ilm that it will be among the first sunnahs and obligations that society will violate.

Reddit,How often and how much do you give tip?,Secure-Confidence-25,"The tipping culture has become a bit absurd lately in Pakistan. Two examples come to mind:   
 1) Back in February, during my wedding, me and my bride were seated on the stage. And we were catered by the wait staff who were bringing us food. When he had finished serving us, right there and then, he asked for a tip. The same happened to my dad who was entertaining guests at that time and this other wait-staff guy had the audacity to ask for a tip in front of his guests.  
 2) This big-name men's salon (T&G): when you are finished with whatever you got done, the staff who cut your hair or whatever comes and stand at the counter expecting tips. I mean, you are paying 2000+ for a simple haircut, shouldn't that be enough?  
 For restaurants, the tip depends on the service. 
 For delivery drivers: 100 minimum.  
 For car mechanics, I remember the line used to be ""yeh le yar, chaaye pee lein in ki"" and 50 would suffice. Now that a chaaye ka cup is 80+, again 100 is minimum.  
 For house help, I feel that they are almost like family so they get trinkets of tips all month. For instance, if the task of the day is to move furniture, they get a tip. Basically anything that involves a non-routine task gets a tip. This is separate from the clothes etc that they get.  
 That said: having lived in Europe for now close to 5 years, I have never tipped even once. It is such an American concept.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1k4tdrf/how_often_and_how_much_do_you_give_tip/

Reddit,Your friendly neighbourhood pixel artist here.,where_is_banana,"Rant incoming. Their style is absolutely very distinctive but that's pretty much where the pros of these buses end imo, apart from how many routes there are and their timings.  
 There aren't any designated stops, so you have to loudly bang on the rear door to get the driver to stop.  
 The driver barely even stops lol, they just slow down until you can barely get off. That combined with how high the steps on these buses are makes it incredibly dangerous, even for young people. 
 These buses are old, like from the 80s minimum if I'm not wrong. They're held together by strings. 
 They're also cramped as hell, even when there's not many people on. It may be a funny experience and sight to sit on the roof, but come on man. That's not how public transport should be like, people who can't afford their own transport are also human beings. 
 In some areas, you can easily get pick-pocketed on them due to the narrow exit at the back. Happened to someone I know. And there won't be anyone to take responsibility for it. Sure, you should be more vigilant of your belongings, but that's akin to victim blaming.

 Basically the army doing business is indicative of weak country and economy. Look at Myanmar, they have the same way. The army there owns huge amount of businesses, industry, shipping. Same with Brazil in the past and some other nations. 
 But a lot of those countries reformed and knew that handing such a large portion of their economy to army leads to anti-competitive actions and hampering of foreign investment in those industries. This affects the economy.

 Irish Americans are another group.  They funded terrorism in Northern Ireland despite most northern Irish wanting to remain in the UK.  But they didn’t have any idea about what was going on there, so Irish people and British people paid the price while these LARPers sat back and patted themselves on the back like they accomplished more than just death.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1j4n0p3/new_trump_travel_ban_could_bar_afghans_pakistanis/

Reddit,I [29M] just got intimate pictures from my wife's [24F] ex-boyfriend,Curious_Rddit,"My friend I think as a sincere human you could look over many faults of your partner and perhaps that may work out for you. However, human beings are weak and what typically would occur in a situation like this is massive trust issues.  
 For example,  when your wife is alone or gone out or wants to work, you will always have this history on the back of your mind. If you're strong minded, maybe you could get past this. But if you have trust issues, you will continue to bang your head against the wall. 
 I suggest that you discuss what your wife wants from bottom of her heart. Tell her you are a friend in this matter and you want to resolve this. If ex and her are in love, then parents should have married them (especially after the intimate history). If everything can happen mutually and without drama, it may be better to separate ways now and let both lovers marry. Alternatively, if wife says that she made a mistake and wants to be with you then you have to make the decision. Could you blindly trust her for good? Do not be in this half hearted. Especially when kids come, you don't want to bring this history forward. And you can not do this as a ""favor"" to her. If you want to move forward, it has to be on equal footing and you can never use this as a hand over her when you two have arguments. 
 To be honest, personally I would not care about intimate history as long as she has moved on. 
 However you could use this point in marriage to steer her towards the correct path. If she's not religious perhaps push her towards that. She will love you for your good heart inshAllah l. 
 It's unfortunate that this has fallen on your shoulders but based on how you are handling this so far I think you will make the correct choice",16 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/13eyf69/i_29m_just_got_intimate_pictures_from_my_wifes/

What a egoistic lowlife jahil person. If she hadn’t done that my brother OP would’ve never had to go through this and those both would’ve been living their lives happily. But OMG she didn’t though about the consequences. 
 I feel you my man (OP). Im both sad and enraged right now, it is a very unfortunate and tough situation you are in, but you already posses a sane and rational mind so you are already on the right and we can only give suggestions. Yes make dua, may Allah pak make everything easy for you and show you a way out of the darkness into the lights ameen. . . . 
 Moreover, its only what i feel, not a suggestion not anything just a feeling on the top what i would do to conclude. 
 If they both still have each other in their hearts, you should ask her sincerely with total openness and seriousness without any strings attached. And ask that man too if he have guts to live with each other if they still love each other as they claim, then you should step aside and let them get married. 
 Its gonna be hard And its gonna be double hard if he just informed you and ruined your life and still don’t want to get her back, you’ll spend your life either with her with a dark scar and thought occurring forever in your mind, or without her. 
 I doubt that you’ll be able to forgive her and love her and forget this issue. 
 Of course we don’t know what is in people’s hearts only Allah knows. 
 Yes people makes mistake and but dhoka/shirk are the things which cannot be forgiven but yet she didn’t betray you it was her past. 
 May be it was her immaturity and she thought that she made a mistake and may be shes loyal to you now may be she’ll love you now or may be she still loves him.

Most people have had partners in the past but it's best to keep that hidden for your partners sanity. Knowing your wife has been with other men in the past with proof and then staying with her would just destroy your sanity and you'll look at yourself as a cuck. I know in the past the women I've been with and now when I see them with their husbands trying to live a ""good"" life; I regretfully have no respect for these men as I had their wives before they married. I would cut my losses right here, your marriage is still in its infancy. The best thing to do is find yourself a spouse, we don't live in the same world that our parents lived in. 90% of the people nowadays have had past relationships and there's a lot of research which shows that the more partners you have, the chances of cheating grows exponentially. This is a really tough situation for you, but you got one life and want to make the most of it. I see my own brother going through somewhat of a similar issue and his life is a living hell. Unfortunately he's too invested in the marriage and loves his wife too much to see it as such because of deep manipulation.

Reddit,I [29M] just got intimate pictures from my wife's [24F] ex-boyfriend,roar_2020,"First of all... your parents seems simple and even if they tried to find they would not have found much. 
 Do think you rushed in but it could be that you saw her and couldn't control your own desires for her. But it is what it is. 
 At this point, you need to take a contrarian view as if you just go with what is coming to your mind in the moment you won't be making the right decision. Few things to put in your head: 
 #1: The  ex of your now wife is a BIG A**HOLE . No man who claim to have ever loved someone would release these kinds of pictures. 
 #2: Clearly  he is a MANIPULATIVE SON OF A BIT*H . He wants you to get angry so you divorce your wife and then he gets to go after her. Clearly, your wife's mom won't have any choice but to re-marry her divorced wife to that sore loser. And then he will get to control her and probably abuse her all her life. Do you really want to loose to a sore loser like this? because that will make you a bigger sore loser.  
 #3: Most guys here saying to leave her clearly are emotional guys like you. Right now you need to  control your emotions . It also helps you grow as a person. 
 #4: Revisit why you married your wife. I knew my wife had exes but it didn't matter. It's not like those exes leave some kind of deposits in the female vagina for rest of her life.  Think as an evolved man instead of some cave man . Focus on the qualities for which you married her. Do you think she would be good mother to your kids? and love them? and raise them well? 
 #5: So what she made a mistake in her life and fell for a loser. Life is long and everyone makes few mistakes in their lives.  Learn to forgive her.  Focus on building something. 
 #6:  Divorced man is also not a good badge to have.  Do you really want to divorce someone for something they did in the past life? If she was cheating with her ex then yeah we would have had a different discussion. She clearly have been loyal to you after nikkah. 
 #7: Maybe give a break in intimacy and try not to make babies for few months. The ultimate reason men want virgins is that they want ABSOLUTE surety that the baby is theirs. As no man wants to raise another man's baby. So what if she is not a virgin when you married her.  All it matters is she gives you a baby that you can be sure is yours . 
 #8: Perhaps  put in some ground rules to rebuild trust . This could be going too far but ask your wife that to rebuild trust you would need access to her phone and passwords to her e-mails for near future till trust is restored. And that you will do random checks without her knowing. See how she reacts. I went through something like this. I wavered and was talking to someone and my wife found out about it. So to rebuild the trust I let her have access to my passcodes. It helped her to re-trust me and I have been a good boy since then too. 
 Anyways, long reply. But it is a shitty situation you are in. Don't make more shitty by doing the first thing that comes to your mind.

Reddit,Women health!!! say no to pills,Plus-Sheepherder9413,"My opinion is that teaching women and girls that birth control pills are going to cause hormonal imbalance and are bad for them and slow killers is probably more harmful to women's health and well-being. Birth control pills are very well studied and have been shown to be very safe and can actually help reduce the hormonal fluctuations and irregularities that women experience due to their normal menstrual cycle. Further, taking pills to delay the menstrual cycle is also medically shown to be safe through numerous studies and clinical trials. I'm not saying that there are not risks and occasional side effects, but it is overall considered very safe.  
 You are pro-women. I am pro-women. We have the same goal, to empower women. I am definitely and strongly against anyone making a woman feel that she has to take pills to participate in her religion fully, and that she is sinful for having a period. That is wrong and exploitative. What I am for is empowering women to live their lives in the way they would like to. If what they want to do is to fast and pray throughout Ramadan to feel closer to Allah, and they want to take pills to achieve that, then I am for helping them have as many options as they want to have. It is their body, and their choice, and their relationship with Allah.

 There is NO sin at all if a bleeding woman does not pray or fast! These pills are literally used to stop pregnancy and have a huge traumatic effect on women physically.

Reddit,Creepy stares on vacation,MyCarRoomba,"Does early exposure to sexEd lead to what the west is dealing with at the moment? 
 
 I don't necessarily think sex ed causes any problems in the west. Unless we're talking about abstinence education. The reality is that human beings are inherently sexual beings and going to have sex whether hidden or open, whether through (Trigger:CSA)  shameful rape of a street kid , or being able to safely and consensually meet on Tinder to do it, knowing there are government protections for you if something goes wrong. We need laws and protection for wives to not have to undergo any abuse, especially to not feel they ""owe"" sex to husbands. The fundamentals aren't there in Pakistan for female safety. The west is dealing with a whole basket of its own worms not gonna lie, and a lot of that is due to still being under a patriarchal society. Pakistan, I would consider to be  hyper -patriarchal. For example, a girl born in a rural village or city outskirts has no chance of making her own decisions in life. She has no opportunities, or a bare-nothing chance to gain any independence. These are crucial things to address before we can think about what the rest of the world is dealing with.  
 
 i think the repression may come from a place of prevention from the parents 
 
 Personally, I think the repression comes from a chastity culture which was also influenced by Islam. Things like purdah, hijab, shaytaan being with a non-mahram one-on-one opposite sex interactions. We even encourage children to wear hijab. Of course, when it's drilled into your head from Day 1 how wrong zina is, how ashamed of our sexual feelings we should be, how ashamed of our bodies we are, it's going to influence a sense of sexual repression. When the only ""halal"" way you can touch a member of the opposite sex is until after you're married, people are going to be absolutely touch-starved. It going against human nature to live this way. This culture eventually breeds heinous men, and women who have to walk on eggshells to get approval from the men of society. 
 
 As parents should we bear the responsibility of treating children as adults in respect to sexuality ie you have been informed make your own decision? 
 
 Treating children as adults in regards to sexuality is absolutely NOT what we should do or what anyone should strive to do. Teaching children healthy boundaries and that it's safe to come to you, as the parent, no matter what happens to them and if they feel any level of discomfort. Teach it from a safety perspective, rather than from a shame-based perspective. Be objective about body parts, hormones, puberty, etc. It's just biology. Obviously, teach them certain info accordingly as they grow up, not just info-dumping this stuff to an 8-year-old. 
 
 how to approach that in a healthy way so as to not push them either way. 
 
 By teaching them scientifically, and objectively. Not filtered through religion, or sharam, or manly/womanly duties. 
 
 sexual repression on one side leading to what we deal with or open normalcy of sexuality leading to what the west deals with. 
 
 There is absolutely a balance. I don't think we should encourage people to go out naked. I think we should be able to mix as boys and girls without feeling any shame. Treat each other as fellow human beings rather than another species.

 Regarding why a bunch of men here do it, it's because of living repressed lives and having no real experience with people from the opposite gender.

Reddit,Creepy stares on vacation,Silverberryvirgo,I’m so sorry you experienced that. As a Pakistani living abroad I think that is one of the few reasons I don’t care to go back to Pakistan to even visit. I’d feel so unsafe and uncomfortable walking out in public. A couple years ago my sister went back to Pakistan for a vacation and she got her butt grabbed in public. Mind you she was wearing a hijab and your traditional Pakistani clothing. It was disgusting. So much for the ISLAMIC republic of Pakistan.,1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1e367ai/creepy_stares_on_vacation/
Reddit,Creepy stares on vacation,Heliumorchid,"I'm an Indian man who likes to lurk around here (I am somewhat fascinated by Pakistan). I've never been to Pakistan but this phenomenon is present in  India too, perhaps not to this exaggerated degree. An attractive woman who's been to both India and Pakistan might be more qualified to comment on that.  
 Before I say what I wish to say I want to add a disclaimer that by no means am I justifying the choice of these men to do what they do. My reason for doing this is purely to help everyone understand the true underlying reasons why there is such a high degree of prevelance of this phenomenon in these societies.  
 This phenomenon, while it is unfortunate, is not entirely unexpected given the following factors:-
1. You're in a sexually repressed society. Men typically don't get as much as they want. It is human to have desires and when desires aren't fulfilled it will have to find fulfillment in other ways. I don't know what goes on in the minds of these men but they're probably just relishing in the sights and indulging in a fantasy of some sort. A lot of people refer to this as ""being r ped by eyes"". And r pe is more common in societies that are sexually repressed. 
2. From what I've seen Pakistan has a very strong prevalence of cultural/religious posturing. Everyone wants to appear culturally and religiously pious. This leads to further suppression of instinct. In my estimation most people have deep rooted desires that they cannot even express. It inevitably leads to relying on fantasies to fulfill their needs. Taking in the sights is just fodder for those fantasies. 
3. Most people simply do not have sufficient life experience. This is the bottom line. You will not find that anyone in Pakistan who is evolved as an Individual with varied life experiences and a certain degree of spiritual evolution would engage in this kind of behavior. People like that can recognize the consequences of their action and would not want to make anyone suffer. On the contrary, someone who is on the opposite side of the spectrum may not even realize how their actions make others feel. They simply may not have sufficient self awareness for this.  
 Like I said I do not wish to justify the actions of these men. But I want to arrive at real longterm solutions rather than some moral messaging or rant.  
 The conclusion here is that you're not going to witness any change in this cultural phenomenon unless you address the following:-
1. Invest in individual growth. This starts from making your economy flourish. A greater economic freedom means individuals have means to afford varied life experiences that leads to greater personal growth. The problem in question is not an isolated problem. It is one of the many side effects of widespread poverty in individual personal growth. You can't ask a hungry man to act with dignity. Dignity is the least of his problems. Staring at a beautiful woman for free and gaining some pleasure in an otherwise lackluster life is inevitably more attractive than if you had a lot better things to do with yourself. 
2. Promote greater freedom of sexual expression. I know it's easier said than done. As long as there is an aversion to sexual freedom you'll have to live with hidden forms of sexual expression. What you wish to do but cannot do openly, you will most likely do in hiding. ""As long as you don't get caught"" That would be the focus until people don't feel threatened from being able to express natural instincts.  
 I hope I've not offended anyone wirh this. It's my first time posting here. Not sure of the policy of posts from indians on this sub. I just wanted to add some value to the discussion.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1e367ai/creepy_stares_on_vacation/

It doesn’t matter what you’re wearing, whether it’s shalwaar kameez or abaya, but of course if you wear western clothes it just amplifies the stares.  
 Guys in the United States stare also,and some make it obvious and some look away. It’s unfortunately a guy thing, and it’s gross and frustrating. However, in Pakistan, it is more intense and obvious and by a good amount of guys whereas in the US, there will be one or two guys in that certain location you’re at, who are doing it. Also, in the US, they will ask for your number or approach you that way, rather than catcalling which is just gross.

 In my view, this is an internal issue in the country and how people being raised and the things they are being taught. To exacerbate this issue, there are little to no consequences of bad behaviour by parents or by the government. Theres corruption at every level in the government, so no one gives a crap about duty its just all about money and power. 
 To make matters worse for Pakistanis (as if things cant get any worse) our image is also made worse, by the fact that people who are not from the subcontinent think that Pakistanis and Indians are the same. Which is true to a certain extent (ethnically) but of course there are many dimensions where we are not the same, least of all, nationally. But the behaviours are so similar in some cases, that its almost impossible to distinguish between the 2. 
 Pakistanis, not just inside Pakistan but also outside Pakistan really need to get their act together and have a sense of civic duty towards our collective image. We no longer live in the 7th century, if one of us does something bad, that will be shared amongst other people on the other side of the world before you even get home to go to sleep. 
 This is a major reason why theres so little tourism in Pakistan also, because other people have such a bad perception of us, and as much as I dont want to believe it, it is true. And only we are to blame for that. 
 I think this is a grass roots solution for this issue. It has to go bottom up, and I think that, within itself, will solve a number of other issues along the way.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ngt1rk/a_disappointing_experience_on_a_flight_from/

Reddit,My worse experience in international flight home,DesiAuntie,"That’s so sad and fucked up. Please don’t think I’m trying to shame you with my suggestion or that I think anything here is your fault but sometimes it helps to think what you would do if this ever happened again. I would say don’t be afraid to cause a scene. Not everyone will be on your side but staying quiet to make people comfortable is not the point of living.  
 Dont be afraid to press the button to call a flight attendant or anyone or authority when you’re in these situations. Even if the flight is full, and you think there’s nothing someone can do, even the fact that you called someone over and said “this person is in my space and I’m uncomfortable” is enough to make them stop.  
 I was recently on a full flight and this fat old white buy beside me kept manspreading and doing the fake sleep on shoulder move. I called the flight attendant and said this man was touching me without my permission. She made him wake up and told him he would have to stay awake if he can’t sleep without spreading his legs or leaning on me. He tried it two more times and I called the lady over two more times before she found me someone to switch with. No one said anything but I felt like people were looking at me weirdly and honestly if I was younger it would have affected me a lot. Now, IDGAF. 
 I was waiting for my bag later and I had several women come up to me and tell me I was brave for speaking up. One of them told that she once pretended to be asleep during a flight while the guy beside her touched himself under a blanket because she didn’t want to cause a scene. She was so old and so sad telling me this I literally had to give her a hug.  
 Make a scene. Do it for everyone. Do it so women younger than us don’t feel ashamed to speak up.

Reddit,My worse experience in international flight home,Equal-Freedom1558,"I’m a male, and I absolutely hate taking flights to Pakistan. One of the main reasons I always try to book premium economy or business class—especially on the legs to Pakistan—is the unbearable behavior of some passengers, but I understand that not everyone has that option. This is also the reason why I don’t fly with PIA from Canada even though it’s the quickest way to get home. From the moment you get in line to board the aircraft to when you leave the destination airport, you’re constantly forced to deal with the obnoxious and ignorant behavior of our people, both men and women.  
 As for your situation, sometimes taking the middle road is the best way to avoid unnecessary stress. You could have simply asked the flight attendant for a seat change (though it’s unlikely they would help) or even asked the uncle beside you, regardless. And guess what? After telling the uncle for your reason to switch, that guy would have had an incredibly uncomfortable rest of the flight. I can assure you that your refusal to budge didn’t change his character—it only gave him a challenge.

(Not all of them are like that though) They would not even hesitate to make the life of flight attendants miserable. Its practically a bus ride from lahore to pindi with kids crying, throwing stuff away, damaging the plane, harrassing/arming the bypassers while sitting at aisle seats. would not care if the plane is anchored and you are allowed to take your cabin luggage but rather start making a chaos as soon as the plane touches the ground. Another thing i observed and highly dislike, is that even on airports in lines, they dont maintain enough distances rather keep pushing you from behind, bhai thora fasla rakh lyyy. 
 anyways, i would suggest to do an online checkin before your flight and book a seat(checkin opens 24hours before the flight). its mostly free. for certain seats with extra leg space, you have to pay but not much.

Reddit,My worse experience in international flight home,Remarkable_Security9,"Honestly, flights from international airports to Pakistan, especially when traveling from the Middle East, can be quite challenging. While flights from the West to the Middle East are generally comfortable, the experience deteriorates once you reach the terminal for flights to Pakistan. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the bathrooms in those terminals often have an unpleasant smell, particularly from the urinals. 
 I’ve observed that many Pakistani men traveling from the Middle East, often from working-class backgrounds, tend to have a lack of personal boundaries. Unfortunately, they sometimes engage in inappropriate behavior, like constantly staring at women. Additionally, their personal hygiene is often lacking, and their attire—particularly the colorful shalwar kameez—can come across as out of place. I have the impression that many of these individuals may come from the Seraiki belt or rural areas in Sindh. 
 Another issue I’ve noticed is the lack of basic manners: these individuals often won’t stand in line or wait for the first passengers to disembark before pushing forward. It’s frustrating and reflects a broader societal issue. I do feel ashamed at times of this aspect of our community. This same restlessness and disregard for basic etiquette can also be seen in our traffic, where the lack of adherence to traffic rules and civic sense is evident.

Ask me anything! 😃,ZenithIrfan,"I’ve actually made a bunch of Reels and videos on this topic, you can check them out on my Instagram. You’ll need to scroll down a bit, but I’ve covered a lot of this stuff there. 
 Now, when it comes to safety, here are a few things I always recommend: 
 1.  Don’t travel after sunset

2.  Always let someone you trust know where you’re going and your plan for the next couple of days

3.  Keep emergency contact numbers written down in a small notebook or address book, not just on your phone. Phones can die, and you don’t want to be stuck

4.  Make sure the hotel you stay at has good reviews

5.  Trust your instincts. If something feels off, it probably is.
 
 As for hotels, there are tons of options these days, especially in northern Pakistan. You can find plenty of safe and well-reviewed places online. And when it comes to fuel, don’t worry too much. People often think traveling by bike will burn a hole in your pocket, but it’s actually pretty economical compared to cars. Bikes use way less fuel and can take you to some incredible places at a fraction of the cost. 
 Of course, the type of bike you use matters. If you’re just starting out, go for something smaller, like a Honda CD 70 or a Suzuki GD 110. These are great beginner bikes. Start with short trips, like if you’re in Islamabad, try a ride to Murree. Or if you’re in Lahore, ride to Islamabad. 
 When I first started, I rode the GT Road on a Honda CD 70. It was perfect for learning because the road has all kinds of challenges: different obstacles, gear shifting, braking, everything. It’s a great way to build your skills and confidence without jumping straight into long or complicated rides.

Reddit,Women are a liability.,Top-Metal-3576,"It’s genuinely so debilitating to be a woman in pakistan. Genuinely if you don’t have a male figure in your life you’re royally fucked, that’s why they put such an importance on male children since the women are essentially restricted from any form of human contact and interaction.  
 Personally living and growing up in the west I’ve had so much freedom compared to grown adult women in pakistan. Whenever I go back I’m always surprised at the sheer amount of things and restrictions they have to go through just to hang out with friends, go out for a walk, go shopping etc.  
 I’m happy my extended family is more progressive so my female cousins are allowed to hang out with friends, go to college, have a social life without the help of their brothers or fathers but its insane how normalized just locking your daughters up in the homes has become. 
 The fact that they literally have to make a day specially for families because the sheer amount of men that go out and harass women was too much.  
 Our society has driven such a wedge between both the genders that men don’t even view women as humans with thoughts and feelings. It’s amplified when they DO get married and don’t even know much about their bride to be other than what she looks like.  
 It’s only the upper class that have access to safe areas like restricted suburbs, parks, malls, cafes etc. If you’re unlucky and born into a family with financial instability you’ll end up in some dark alley way deep into a random apartment complex.  
 We had to drive a young maid home to her house in pakistan cause it was late, and I was just scared for how she even moves about in an area like that.  
 Corruptions seems to prevail and it’s genuinely disheartening seeing your country turned into a massive hell hole. We have so much to give as a country yet we’re stopped at every achievement.

Reddit,Women are a liability.,battlewisely,"The Quran talks about ""the spirit of inspiration"", unfortunately the men don't lower their gaze and the spirit of inspiration hits them in the wrong way and they blame the women for it. 😂 This is a deep psychological and even spiritual thing that has symptoms and repercussions in the society. But it's as much the women themselves that make each other the liability because they don't protect each other or support each other and the reason for that is most likely jealousy. So that's a spiritual sickness that corrupts the heart.The scripture & faith should purify the heart but maybe somehow the religion hardens the heart. Islam came before the religion was formed, it entered into the heart of the prophet by the spirit of inspiration.

 From a young age men are never taught how to properly interact / treat women and vice versa.
When they become adults and have influence/power, they pull the unfortunate shit that happens due to lack of restraint, pent up sexual frustration and lack of basic education and moral decency making society unfortunately far more unsafe for women than it is elsewhere.  
 Most of our rural population is uncivilized and uneducated, numerous videos online show how these bastards act around women abroad, inki harkaton se ab Pakistani passports pe Visa lagna band hogye hein. This is what they do abroad, imagine the shit they pull within their own localities.

Reddit,Women are a liability.,JellyKinggg,"That is exactly what I think to myself as well. I would much rather prefer if my sister went to school or college or Uni herself, do everything she wants to do, without having to seek permission from anyone in the family. The problem is that men have made this society extremely difficult and dangerous for women to go out alone. They do not even spare women who go out with someone(look at the Motorway case from a few years ago). Which is why most families do not want their women to go out alone. 
 While it’s true that there are people who are just strict on women for no reason other than that they just happen to be women, he sad truth of the matter is that our society is not safe for women to go out alone. To give you some context, I see a lot of girls riding bikes and scooters to school, college or work, bring groceries and do everything that a man does on a bike. Instead of appreciating these women, most people I see on the road just stare at them as if they are looking at some freak exhibit. That makes these women uncomfortable.

Reddit,Women are a liability.,stresscake,"I strongly feel like you missed my point though.  
 Of course the lack of safety on the streets isn’t that women are not granted their freedom. That is in fact a direct result of the lack of safety itself. If I lived in Pakistan I would treat my daughters the same probably as the majority of Pakistanis treat their daughters.  
 I think I have lots of responsibilities out in the world actually. I drop and pick our kid from pre-school, do all the grocery shopping, take care of the garbage disposal, get the car washed, buy our kids clothes, take him to get haircuts, take him to his doctor appointments and check ups, I do groceries for my mom and mother-in-law sometimes, I take my son to play group, I’m part of this local group of neighbours that clean the streets once a month, I am part of a local political group so I can help improve my city, I volunteer on jummah at my local mosque. Lots of stuff.  
 Some of these things are household responsibilities that I don’t have to burden my husband with. He works so hard to provide for me, I don’t mind washing his car for him or buying the things he puts on the grocery list. Others are things that I morally find important and I want to teach my son that taking care of his neighbourhood is his responsibility too. Cleaning the streets, sacrificing his time and efforts for his neighbourhood.  
 Apart from this I have a parttime job too. I work in a school and work in a team that helps at-risk youths (many of which girls).  
 You can say these things are not my responsibility because you believe I should be cooking, cleaning and teaching my son. But I find that these things are direct values I add to the society I live in. I find it my responsibility to actively do work that makes me useful to the greater good.  
 Apart from that I face the world on occasion simply to have some fun sometimes. It may shock you, but that’s not illegal. I like to see my friends in the park, grab a coffee, read a book in the sun, visit a museum.

Reddit,How to talk to the petrol pump guy?,Najam99,"If you have a Mira and you get the tank filled up when only one bar is left, then I don't think your tank gets full with 5k. I think Mira has around 28 liters of capacity. At the current rate of Rs. 252/liter, 5k will get you around 19 liters of petrol. You can get it filled up more if you want. It's completely your preference. What I usually do is I tell them ""Full kar den"". They fill it up. Now, for example, if it comes to something like 5430, I tell them to make it 5500, because a whole amount is easier.  
 It is completely your preference if you want to get the tank filled up in liters, but the above is just an easier way without getting into any calculations. 
 As far as the different kinds of petrol are concerned, yes, there are indeed two different kinds of petrol. One is normal petrol which is regulated by the government and you'll find its price consistent across all petrol stations. The other one is high octane or some call it Euro 5. It's more refined, good for the engine and gives you better fuel economy. However, it is expensive and unregulated. That means the rate of that petrol varies by each brand of petrol pumps as they are free to price it however they want. If you can find it with very little difference from the normal petrol, you should get it. Otherwise, it's your choice whichever you want",13 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1hu0sjp/how_to_talk_to_the_petrol_pump_guy/

My mother moved to lahore to be next door neighbors with my khala. She had retired from government service and found herself lonely in islamabad as she had no family there. She is now 82. Has a live in maid, no male servants because of the safety factor. Her maid's family is somewhat reliable and i pay them more than market rate to keep them around. I have cctv in the whole house, ptcl phone, manage all payments online and pay a female relative monthly to visit her now and then, for bank visits etc. If ammi wants to go visit her brother or any other relatives I arrange for a car. She stopped driving 2 years ago due to mild dementia. Although it's a solitary life, I think her independence and autonomous is beyond precious. She eats, sleeps, watches TV, enjoys her evening walks with her sister alhamdulillah and mashallah. I would never trade these for anything. As a female I feel it would kill her and me, if she was made to feel like a burden on anyone, (ie brothers or son in law). It's hard to be independent and then have to share space with others. 
Just FYI, I wouldn't rely on relatives too much. In this day and age people don't really care much for silah rehmi. Only care for what benefits they will get. Ammi rarely has visitors.

 You can join social sports groups and make tons of friends. You could then organise board games or whatever you wanted with them. 
 Regarding the weather yeah it's very cold and rains a lot but hey the air quality is breathable unlike lahore where you'd start coughing even if you didn't do cardio that day. 
 There's plenty of natural scenery around Wicklow etc. And at least public transport exists that can take you there and back. Can you say that for Pakistan? 
 Yes the lack of food variety vs UK is real and not everything is halal. Your point about the alcohol focused culture also stands correct. However to counter the booze, I simply join as many social sports clubs as I can. They're stress free and people are very friendly. 
 Try wall climbing or bouldering. There's a few venues with a lot of options.

In a patriarchal society like ours, it’s obviously even worse for women. At least, most men have the luxury of being able to go out whenever they desire and at the very least, being able to sit at chai restaurants shooting sh*t with their mates.  
 OSP’s on here who are talking about not having much to do abroad other than partaking in the drinking culture obviously have no lives and haven’t been able to integrate successfully in to the societies they live in.  
 If you’re somewhat social and reside in a vibrant metropolitan city in North American or Europe ( I’ve done both ), there’s ample to do. Just a couple of months ago, I attended a live music event where I rain in to a bunch of Erasmus students, an investment banker from South Africa and a graphic designer from Russia. We all ended up hanging out and having a great night. And this was on a Monday night.  
 And these opportunities for socializing aren’t just limited to the Western countries. A few years ago, I was in Colombo. There was a cricket game going on between Pakistan and Australia. I went to a pub to watch the game and ended up sitting next to a couple of guys from Australia. We spent hours just chatting about the game. Can you ever see that happening in Pakistan ?  
 That said, grass isn’t always greener on the other side. There are definite upsides to living in your own country and life aboard isn’t easy by any means. Especially in this socioeconomic climate.

 This too shall pass. Just like when you feel life is so good. Life becomes routine and it is required to sometimes remember to appreciate and enjoy what good there is. If you are bored it means you are likely safe with a fully belly.  Things that were once desired and then obtained become normalized and are no longer exciting- excitement is fleeting. It doesn't matter what you accomplish, buy, where you visit, what you see or what adrenaline rush you experience, you will always return to who you are. 
 Boring is often not about a place, its usually about an individual/mindset. What do you do to occupy and enjoy yourself? do you read, do something creative (music, art), community oriented (help those in need, mentorship), skill building, how do you play (sports, video games, cards/board games) 
 are you really looking for entertainment or meaningful companionship, or other social relationships, or solitude or contemplation time and so on. (No need to answer, but you should consider the question) 
 is it a life 'stage'? I have a 3 year old and a 5 year old, I moved from Chicago to a suburb 3 years ago and my life now is fairly boring (although very fulfilling) compared to what it was 10 years ago when I had ample one on one time with my spouse and access to neighborhood festivals, theater and lots of live music with friends (what I enjoy), now I can't even find a good cup of coffee 
 Do you think the other people (e.g. woman) near you feel the same way? Be bored together! Try new hobbies, activities, experiences ect. together. There has been a lot of mention about the lack of parks, could you work with your community to establish a small green space, guerilla garden or group activity (bird watching?)

 Last time I visited Pakistan, I was at a bazar with my uncle….I saw a kulfi cart walk by and wanted to try some. As my uncle was talking to the kulfi guy, some guy came up behind me and started catcalling…he was about to grab my waist as I screamed and made a run for it. The guy literally chased me for half a block….with my uncle chasing after him…It was SO scary. I was also covered head to toe in hijab and Chadar…and this was in broad daylight in public. I have never experienced anything like that in America…even at rave concerts where people are packed together. In Pakistan, even if women go out with their dads, brothers, husbands…they will not feel comfortable.  
 So, it kind of feels like how being in covid quarantine feels like…that’s the closest feeling to it. Just stay at home and only leave if absolutely necessary. It’s very very very depressing.  I was literally counting my days so we could leave. Also, the issue isn’t lack of resources, it’s culture. The same men do the same things as immigrants in other countries.

 My parents didn't bring me into this world because they wanted me to take care of them in retirement. They just wanted to have children.  An innate human desire.  Ask your parents if the sole reason they had you because they wanted a retirement plan. If they say yes then I really don't have anything to say except that I'm sorry for you. 
 You seem to think I'm miserable or something and resent having to be responsible for my family. I don't know if you're just young or you just weren't raised right so I'll explain it as simply as possible: It an honour to be relied upon. I love my family and would do anything for them, and Alhamdulliah I make more than enough money to take care of all of them without any issues. I don't expect anything out of it, I wasn't told to take care of my family by anyone. I just knew it had to be done and stepped up to provide as best as I could because that's what a man does. I know other people in similar situations who aren't as lucky as I was and my heart goes out to them. They have my utmost respect. 
 You also completely missed the main point I was trying to make. I'll try to be as brief as possible: ""You can only retire without depending on other people if you already have the means to financially support yourself to do so. You can only financially support yourself after retirement if your economic situation allows you to save and invest your money for future use or if you have a government provided safety net to fall back upon. The economic situation in Pakistan, its rising inflation rates and government support programs aren't a good environment for this kind of retirement model"". 
 If you disagree with these points then say so. If your only gripe is with people having children without achieving the financial success that allows them to retire without having to rely on said children (An absurdly high benchmark in this country) then say that. If your gripe is with people having children late in life and thus being in situations where they have to retire before their children are financially stable then say that.

Reddit,Pakistan is drowning.,Either_Band_2777,"Anyone that believes this is not a government issue are extremely naive. This is not an issue of overpopulation.  
 Anyone that believes that we are a “low resource country” is extremely naive. This is because of our governments.  
 Maybe if flooding affected the country once or twice or even three times then one can blame other contributing factors.  
 Our governments have done nothing to prevent any flooding. 
 No proper urban planning with proper drainage systems. Doesn’t matter if the city is Karachi, Lahore, Sialkot or Kartarpur.  
 Doesn’t matter how big or small our cities are - our governments have done nothing. If drainage systems were well designed for smaller cities/towns but not for overpopulated metropolitan areas, then we could potentially blame overpopulation.  
 No dams have been built to redirect water from flood affected regions. Dams don’t just provide clean, renewable electricity they are vital to reduce flooding too.  
 Climate change effects - no trees have been planted to counter the effects of climate change. In fact the country has become more barren over the last few years. They have completely destroyed the greenery of Islamabad. Trees help regulate weather and rains. Forrests help reduce water flow and can reduce effects of flooding.  
 No proper public transport systems have been made. Only extravagant mega projects within small sections of the city to provide optics, fool the masses and of course get commissions.   
 Our over reliance on energy extracted from burning coal. Anyone that believes all these cars and bikes on the road are seriously affecting our climate due to fossil fuel emissions (which is also true)  should actually be pushing for renewable energy. Building dams would’ve provided clean and cheap energy also would’ve resolved the huge load shedding issue which  has/had an unmeasurable effect on our economy.  
 Our country is over 70 years old. Our governments have done nothing, had no vision to provide for the people. They have always first thought of themselves and have always just thought of how to win the next election. No long term planning. No continuation of previous government policies that actually are better for society.

 Climate change is a global issue. Of which the biggest emissions, by far, are by the top world powers. Pakistan is one of the lowest contributors of greenhouse gases (because of the lack of heavy industries) 
 Dams are tricky. Building damns destroy entire ecosystems. They’re not a magic solution. 
 A Dam has a capacity. Dams vs Nature => dams will lose each time. Even the largest dam in the world cannot prevent flooding across a region. A dam is locked physical on a location - it may help in its capacity, but it wont fix other screwups. 
 Dams are super expensive infrastructure and require high upfront capital. We broke. 
 Load shedding issues are largely caused by financial mismanagement and not capacity issues. As of 2024 (and probably much earlier), Pakistan can produce excess electricity, if needed. Also, we can make it for cheap.

Reddit,Fat shaming in Pakistan,Brainless_Hi5,"Girl. You wear a medium. There are unrealistic standards of beauty everywhere ofcourse. But even if you were a small or an XS they’d open their box of advice for you on ‘which exercises or foods will help you get a healthy weight’. You can’t win whatever size you are. I’m always told how i’d be prettier if i lost some weight. And how i’d have better prospects. And the toxic advice culture is ridiculous.  
 They always say ‘kitni smart lagogi thora weight kam kar k’… and i always respond k ‘Alhamdulillah. Smart toh mein already hoon. I have a degree. I have a job. Aur smart hone ki zaroorat nhi’  
 Or other times for other stupid comments i just say ‘khatay peetay ghar se hone ki nishani hai.’ (Khata peeta gharana means well off family). They usually laugh and get uncomfortable due to the unexpected answer and start explaining how that’s not what they meant. That’s when you slip away.  
 Another trick is when they start their advice session… just say that you’re doing it already. ‘Oh yes, i’ve been going to the gym already.’ ‘I do clean eat.’ I have been losing weight the past few months, thanks.’  You cut their advice session short and it takes them time to process the next piece of advice… you can again either change the topic or slip away.  
 I would advise to always respond. Just mix it up a bit. Be respectful at times. Be blunt at times. You’ll be entertained and be able to mostly avoid the drama with your mom later. But, always respond. These people have no sense of boundaries or respect for others hence they go around butting into everyone’s business. They should know that your boundaries are not to be crossed.

What is crime is to denie the holocaust (""Volksverhetzung"") and to use certain banned symbols but just saying ""I dont think it happened"" won't be enough, the actions have to be rather drastic. There was a rather famous case of a very right wing/extremist poltician who used to be a history teacher (so public service) but relativized holocaust. He retired volunteerly but it still isn't clear if the state could have fired him over that. He is right now in front of court for using Nazi quotes pretending he didn't know they were. The law is strict and it's very difficult to make a case on something like this and even harder to make that person end up in prison. There was a case of a woman after repeated public interviews denying holocaust and gloryfing who got 2 years in prison but this is really extremely rare to happen. 
Ususally the most that happens (for example for making the Nazi salute) is a fine. And apparently lots of tourist don't care, as sadly, especially during international soccer games, some still think it's a great idea to do.

 BTW blasphemy is not only a Muslim concept and that the law originally was put into place by the British does a point there. There are laws around the world to protect religious sentiments. Many European countries also do have them but they are more used to protect communities from hate speech and not to limit free speech. If it's on small scale again no consequences. And more and more countries abolish them. Law is allowed and has to evolve, just like society. Nothing is forever.  
 Societies have developed: if you went into an European church couple hundreds years ago and said God doesn't exist but the artwork is nice, consequences would have been bad I assume. Today? Most likely people would get into a friendly debate with you or just ignore it. Couple years ago there was a case when a Femen activist jumped naked on the altar during a church service with the words ""I am God"" written on her chest (as part of some political protest). She got only punished for disturbing others while they were trying to perform their rituals and express their beliefs. She had to pay 600€ for that. That's it. No lynching.

Reddit,Almost 4 years in Germany and STILL depressed...,Slothfulness69,"For me, what helped was learning to accept life as it is instead of controlling everything. It’s exhausting trying to manage every single aspect of every single thing. So at some point, I accepted that the path I wanted to take and the path that was meant for me would never meet. And they didn’t. I never did go down that path I thought was right for me. But the path that was actually meant for me made me feel so much better and opened up so many opportunities.  
 I know that sounds really vague but essentially, I never had the career I wanted. In its place, I took a different route and that route opened up opportunities I didn’t know I could ever reach. I didn’t become the rebellious, forever-single party girl I thought I wanted to be. I got married young and learned to love a simple life with my husband, the love of my life. I didn’t force myself to be who society wanted me to be. I accepted myself and my life as it was.  
 Therapy helped too. Talk therapy never worked, but I did EMDR, a therapy designed specifically to treat PTSD, and it helped a ton. I still have PTSD, but it doesn’t impact my life as much anymore. I would do some research on alternative therapies besides CBT (talk therapy). It might help. But beyond that, accept yourself for who you ARE, not who you wish you were. Maybe you’re not the best at math. Maybe you’re not outgoing. Maybe you don’t fit in. That’s all fine. There’s nothing wrong with you if these things are true. You don’t have to be good at math, outgoing, or fit in in order to be a good person and live a happy, meaningful life. You just have to be you. If something makes you happy, do it.  
 There’s no competition here. It’s your life. It doesn’t make sense to compare yourself to others because they’re not you and you’re not them. And again, sometimes the path that’s meant for you isn’t the path you envisioned for yourself. Yeah maybe you might go back to Pakistan. It’s fine if you do. Millions of people have lived and died happily in Pakistan. It’s not the end of the world if you go back so you can be happy and live better.",10 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1l7dlh5/almost_4_years_in_germany_and_still_depressed/

Restricting houses of worship is uncommon even in Sunni-dominated areas of the world - it's certainly not a hallmark of tolerance. Significant Ismaili Jamatkhanas actually are accessible for tours outside of prayer times; it's hard to imagine that Ismailis would provide no access to visit an architecturally significant house of worship, if they had one.

I know it’s heaven for most guys here they have that viewpoint that the grass is greener on the other side but pakistans my greener grass side so don’t come at me with the whole VHY didn’t u stay there because alhamdulillah by heart I consider Pakistan a part of me and myself a paki than a Brit. Furthermore, (for all your queries and thoughts) no the genetics from my mums side have no change in me or any inclination towards kuffr or anything to do with haram and sin, no inclination towards colonisation, or setting up an east India company, or any sort of colonial act, nor do I have an inclination to sleep with a dog like most goray, 
And well everything else in those circumstances,  
 As for me, I’m a student of Quran and Islam to this day, still learning alhamdulillah keep all my fasts, I love Pakistan I got it alright here alhamdulillah, I don’t meet and greet much people I stay inside most the time I’m more likely to be charged double the price because of what I look like, I pay extra every time until I say to them Dhoka na do, and still they do because of the majboori but ain’t nothing wrong with helping ya own people out, 
The weather doesn’t burn my skin because the Pakistani aseel genetics 🧬 overpower the sun so the skin cancer cells don’t work because the melanin from dad is so powerful most my school friends would have peeled in these summers.

I like chickens,  
 What actually drove me here is picking up dad’s responsibility’s, helping out,

But because I’m eldest from siblings I’ve kind of picked up responsibility of things here in pk which is why I’m here for the main part,

 These means this place was submerged deep in the ocean, and the beautiful dolomite mountains you see, was actually an underwater mountain range, no wonder the mountain shapes are so unconventional.

Reddit,Safe to Travel by road Karachi to Islamabad With Family?,utg001,"GT road is okay, we've traveled a lot between Lahore and Karachi, with family and solo as well. Use the Indus Highway when you leave Hyderabad, will save you a couple of hours. Lots of buses and other cars on this route. 
 I would suggest you make pit stops at following locations: 
 Taj Restaurant Morro 
 Petrol pump at the start of motorway near Sukhur 
 Service area just before Multan. Then Lahore, Bhera and pindi. This would divide your journey neatly into 6-8 hr stints. 
 I would also suggest making a overnight stay at Multan or Lahore, otherwise take two drivers as the journey is very long. If you are the only driver then you should leave before 5 or even 4, and take short naps throughout the journey.

I mean you'll have to either cook separately or ask ammi jan to help you with your dietary needs. I am sure she'll understand and cater you accordingly.  
 Also, Try satiating any irregular cravings with fruits, dates, dark chocolate. Make sure to have as much protein as possible. Protein keeps you satiated for long, and, last but not the least, stick to your cycling routine.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/15cg49q/is_it_possible_to_lose_weight_on_a_pakistani_diet/

 The biggest thing is portion control. Diet really doesn't matter, as long as you plenty of protein and follow the concept that calories in<calories out. Desi food is very high in protein anyway, so idk why you are having issues with macros anyway. Also, fasting twice a week, plenty of walking (not running or hard cardio, just walking with proper posture and a good pace). Snacking is also alright, as long as you follow he calorie rule. I actually don't like a lot of Desi snacks anyway so it was probably easier for me.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/15cg49q/is_it_possible_to_lose_weight_on_a_pakistani_diet/

Reddit,Is it possible to lose weight on a Pakistani diet at all?,cen6wkf,"Hey there,  u/retroguy02 ! while I can't fully feel your pain, I can assure you that you're not alone in this culinary conundrum. I used to work in Abu Dhabi for about 2years back in around 2010, and I had my fair share of Biryani Rice, Mutton, Curry Chicken, roasted lambs, you guessed it, I probably tried it. One time after having a roasted meat lunch, my nose bled due to the heatiness. That's when I realize I need to prioritize my well-being over my macho pride. 
 Navigating a Pakistani diet while trying to shed those extra pounds is like trying to balance on a seesaw with a plate of biryani in one hand and a kale smoothie in the other. But fear not, there are ways to make it work without breaking your mom's heart or sacrificing your taste buds. 
 First things first, let's address the oil issue. Desi cooking does love its generous splashes of oil, but you can definitely trim down on this without sacrificing flavor. Try suggesting to your mom to use non-stick cookware or invest in an air fryer. This way, you can enjoy your parathas with less guilt, and your veggies won't feel like they've taken a deep-fried vacation. 
 Now, about those parathas for breakfast. You don't have to bid farewell to these delicious doughy delights. Instead, you can opt for whole wheat parathas and stuff them with veggies or lean proteins like egg whites or grilled chicken. It's all about making those smart swaps. 
 Daal chawal, the ultimate comfort food, right? But that heavy tadka can be a calorie culprit. Ask your mom if she'd be open to using less oil for tadka or even explore tadka-less recipes. You'll still get that wholesome daal chawal experience without feeling like you're swimming in oil. 
 As for those veggies, I totally get it - they can turn into crispy critters with all that frying. How about introducing your mom to the world of steaming or sautéing? Steamed vegetables retain their natural flavors and nutrients, and a light sauté with minimal oil can also do wonders. 
 Now, about addressing the macros. Protein can be a tricky one, especially in a diet rich in carbs and fats. But you can always supplement your desi meals with lean protein sources. Keep some grilled chicken or tofu handy to add to your meals, or sneak in some legumes like chickpeas (chana) or lentils (masoor) for that protein punch. 
 And the portion control part? It's all about moderation. You don't have to devour a mountain of biryani; a small serving with a side of yogurt and salad can be satisfying. 
 Lastly, your mom's love and effort in cooking for you are priceless. You don't have to break her heart with a strict diet. Instead, involve her in your journey. Cook together, experiment with healthier recipes, and turn it into a fun family project. 
 Remember, it's not about completely giving up the foods you love; it's about making mindful choices and finding that desi-diet-meets-weight-loss sweet spot.

Reddit,Got harassed by a gay during travelling.,Glad-Store5548,I have had a similar experience. I'm a guy and once travelled from Quetta to Islamabad by a ride share car (forgot what we call it). Five people in total in a car. The travel was long and went uneventful up until the end. The driver was supposed to drop everyone off at their final destination door. He hadn't said a word to me during the entire trip but had been staring at me from time to time through his rear view mirror. I was the last one left and as he was driving through Islamabad he suddenly stopped somewhere no where near my destination and asked to me to sit in the front seat. I did and he started talking to me about normal things here and there. Finally I asked why has he stopped here and he abruptly asked me to spend the night with him. He wasn't really giving me any creepy vibes and hasn't touched me or anything. And honestly he was quite handsome too. I was nervous about the situation and what he might be capable of. I said no. He insisted a few more times and I kept rejecting politely. Finally he gave me a disappointed look and drove to some dhaba or something and told me he won't be taking me to where I needed to go.

 I personally wouldn’t re-connect with her if I were you. Biggest reason for me is because I do NOT want to be someone’s second option. So they left, made shitty choices and when they reap the results of their own doings - they want to come back and be open to reconnect? Heck no!  
 I’d just advise you to have some self respect. You already threw most of it away when you were begging her to come back. Do you really see yourself being happy with her after all that?  
 She made her choice, she’s got to live with it. Nothing wrong with her looking out for herself in wanting to settle down and marry but it’s weird to have you in her back pocket when her marriage went into the gutter. Those kind of dynamics don’t bode well in a healthy loving relationship.

 As far as students are concerned - yes we should. Language barrier is an issue but there should be intensive short courses to help those who want to study.  
 
 Get stuff where you can get it cheapest. Even better, buy from companies who are willing to come and setup manufacturing locally to meet demand.

Reddit,Why are we not using benefits of friendship with China? 🇵🇰🤝🇨🇳,Small_Ad6037,"See sweet summer child, your assumption is correct but its based on a false worldview. In your worldview china is more powerful as it is doing economically and socially better. But see throughout history a universally superior metric of power has always been capacity for violence. This world that we all live and love where financial benefit is revered and pursued most earnestly was built on the backs of unimaginable violence. And the perpetrator and winner or that contest of violence was none other than ya bot amreeka. 
 If this is hard to understand i dont blame you. Entire post ww2 world has been shaped and trained in American image. So its natural to understand the world by the metrics that American taught you namely econimic development. But one thing that America has kept in its pocket and that has allowed it to remain top dog and even beyond is its unmatched capacity for violence. This ability allows it to upend any and every economic development across the globe. No other entity has this power. 
 See China is a peacetime superpower, if it dont fuck up bad like india it can naturally attain superpower status just by its sheer size and productivity but it lacks one key component, its ability to fuck shit up across the globe. And america is all about fucking shit up. Chinas biggest danger, war, is Americas favorite pastime. This unassailable advantage makes no serious student of war and strategy claim that China will ever upend US. No matter how far and wide Chinas economic web spins from American perspective it will always be over extension and once it gets extended far enough America will snap it just like it did with Nazi germany, japan and soviet union. 
 And even our establishment is not stupid enough to side with the loosing party. Hence we can't go all in on Chinese benefits. We must side mostly with US for the simple reason its the favorites in ongoing global domination struggle and definite favorites in upcoming much more violent struggle.",-1 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1k0j80t/why_are_we_not_using_benefits_of_friendship_with/

Reddit,Jibran Nasir On Traveling From The US During The COVID-19 Crisis,Bottleneck_ram,"Well, most of us are our governments problem. People criticise the government all the time. So that’s not an issue. 
 But yeah, we aren't socialist though. Sided with US during Cold War and stuff. 
 Stuff like free education and healthcare (if the government can manage that one day InshAllah) will get strong support though. Just don’t take away private property and  do not  suppress religion (i.e. don’t go all communist). 
 Actually, on the socialist part. Politics are largely dominated by the landlord class. Farmers and housing estate owners. Media is highly commercialised. (Education sector as well, but changes are planned starting year 2021 which might break down power of private school owners. Unless they manage to find a way out, because some are among the biggest financiers of the current party in power.) Plus, the army owns many assets making it rich and influential. 
 ​ 
 (btw, if you’re really serious about moving it’ll probably be smarter to just keep both your nationalities. There are many people with an American and Pakistani nationality. As a whole the people of Pakistan are quite welcoming. There are so many ethnicities living together, so ethnic differences really aren’t an issue. 
 And Islamabad would be a nice place to live in. Might find sufficient number of people who speak English thanks to a largely urban population. Plus it’s really close to many tourist destinations, the police it’s corrupt - well, at least not openly. The roads are nice, city is really clean, large number of public parks. And as a bonus in case of a war it’s the safest city to be in. Though if you’re hoping for a “fully Islamic environment“ Islamabad would be a bit to liberal for you. Majority is obviously Muslim, so they’ll dress modestly. But in certain areas of the city it won’t be surprising for some girl to decide an even wear shorts. 
 The down side is it’s kind of a boring city - just a city for government stuff. Really not much culture or anything. Maybe just the Faisal Mosque. And the food is also way too low on spices by our standards. 
 Probably just visit as a tourist first though.)",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/fip7zm/jibran_nasir_on_traveling_from_the_us_during_the/

Reddit,Civic sense on airplanes,Far_Emergency1971,"Entitlement culture.  I also travel frequently and every time I’m on a flight full of either Indians or Pakistanis the plane is trashed afterwards, people steal the blankets and pillows, always one guy (almost always an uncle) arguing with cabin crew about putting on a seatbelt or bringing his seat up before takeoff (during Covid it was masks), picking up bags on the conveyor belts and throwing them in the middle off the belt if it isn’t their’s etc.  I went to Saudi and watched a family gather up all the pillows and blankets they could and throw them into one blanket to carry them off the plane and I was so embarrassed.  No wonder the Gulf states dont want us there.  Desi culture is too individualist/tribalist so essentially anyone outside of your immediate family doesn’t exist and their property and rights mean nothing.   
 I have an idea to stop this or at least get us in the right direction.  How about at restaurants for instance like McDonalds or KFC, start taxing people for not throwing away their own trash and just leaving it on the table.  Other countries people throw it away and put the tray on top of the trash can.  Have the security guards take 100 rupees from everyone who doesn’t pick up their own tray.  There’s zero civic sense here so we gotta start somewhere.  Would this tax be abused and probably stolen?  Yeah most likely, but it would instill civic sense into some people at least.  Give police incentives for fining people for littering or dangerous driving.  Extend the school day and give a civics class for every age.   
 Finally anyone caught misbehaving overseas should have their passport revoked and permanently barred from traveling with the exception of Hajj.  China did this when they became rich overnight they had so many paindu types traveling overseas and getting into fights, pooping on the street (one even pooped in the middle of the airplane aisle).  Now that these rules have been in effect for years, Chinese tourists I run into are usually the most well behaved out of everyone.",7 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1i4np56/civic_sense_on_airplanes/

 The user is a 25-year-old female living in Lahore, Pakistan, who moved from Dubai in 2021. She's been struggling to adjust to Pakistan due to various issues like poor healthcare, frequent power outages, theft, and pollution.  
 Recently, she and her family were involved in a severe car accident caused by a drunk driver. Despite the severity of the accident, which left her mother in shock and injured a motorcyclist, the drunk driver faced little consequence due to corruption. The police and judicial system suggested her family accept a bribe and let the driver go, highlighting the country's corruption and lack of justice. 
 She shares this experience to caution others about the dangers on the roads, even in supposedly safer areas, and to underscore the broader issues of corruption and lawlessness in Pakistan. She calls for change, emphasizing that the value of human life seems diminished in her country due to these systemic problems.",3 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1gmgsim/living_in_pakistan_has_been_a_punishment_so_far/

A 25-year-old woman, originally from Dubai but currently living in Lahore, Pakistan, shared her recent traumatic experience of a serious car accident in DHA, Lahore. While returning from Packages Mall with her family, their car was hit by a drunk driver in a pickup truck, causing severe damage. Her family suffered minor injuries, except for her mother who struggled to breathe and was in shock. A motorcyclist also broke his leg due to the crash. Despite clear evidence of the driver's intoxication, the police handled the incident poorly, suggesting bribes to let the offender go free.  
 The woman highlighted her frustration with Pakistan's broken healthcare, unreliable infrastructure, corruption, and lawlessness. She criticized the police and judicial system for their negligence, pointing out that people with money can escape accountability, leaving victims helpless. This incident underscored the widespread injustice in Pakistan, where human lives are undervalued, and corruption prevails. She urged for change, starting with individual accountability, and emphasized the emotional toll of experiencing such injustice firsthand.",5 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1gmgsim/living_in_pakistan_has_been_a_punishment_so_far/

Reddit,Bangladesh needs help,deep_observeration,"My deep observation : 
 On one end Indian state feels happy how they broke Pakistan. But doing this they kind of opened a whole new Pandora box for themselves as well. 
 Indian economy is basically dependent on south India, they are mostly doing the heavy lifting from exports/industry/IT and remittances. The north has basically fallen so behind that these northern state are like random average village in Pakistan. North India is basically one big village. Think of it as a big undeveloped pind. 
 The minority south just can't lift the living standard of northern biharis/UP walas majority own their on.. 
 Indian state deep down fears a successful Bangladesh as an example, as it can send a message how small nation based on ethnicity can excel faster as they don't have to heavy lift other groups.  
 Indian state controlled by northern majority, fears that south India who alone are making around 100+ Billion dollars in IT, can one day wake up, and stop this whole heavy lifting. You can see the whole south vs north fights online, its not that big but it is strong enough to make them worry. 
 They fear them following footsteps of Bangladesh if it got big. 
 If you look into the southern numbers/earning you will think it should have some sort of European standard of living... but it doesn't as it is used to lift northern state. 
 Now, to control that, Indian state basically doesn't want Bangladesh to progress as catch southern eye. Recently they signed an electricity deal, where Bangladesh will be buying expensive electricity from India using coal plants, here Bangladesh needs to pay back $ 13 Billion dollar just as capacity payment... the cost of coal and per unit isn't even included. 
 Basically this is used to control Bangladeshi growth, expensive electricity ---> growth cut.

Reddit,Bangladesh needs help,Humble_Half_1666,"Yes, 30% for the children and grandchildren of the freedom fighters. The protest for quota reformation began last month and ran peacefully for the first 15 days. However, things took a drastic turn when PM Hasina made derogatory remarks, addressing the protesters as the grandchildren of the Razakars (collaborators of 1971). The Awami League General Secretary then called upon the Chhatra League to attack the protesters. They complied, leading to violent clashes. 
 The following day, six protesters died due to police brutality. In the days after, nearly 42 students from various schools, colleges, and private universities also died. These students, who mostly aimed for jobs in the private sector or abroad, joined the protest in solidarity with those beaten previously. Despite not targeting government jobs where quotas apply, they faced severe violence. 
 The next day, the internet was shut down for a week. During this time, police, RAB, SWAT, the Army, BGB, Ansar, the Navy, and Coast Guard (in coastal areas) were all deployed. The police initially used pellet guns, targeting protesters’ eyes, similar to the tactics seen in Kashmir by Indian army. The Army, BGB, RAB, and other elite forces used assault rifles, snipers, and even shot from helicopters. Many children died from gunfire while on their balconies. When the internet was restored, it was confirmed that 267 students had died, mostly from gunshot wounds to the head or eyes. Additionally, a mass graveyard near Dhaka was discovered with 67 bodies buried. The total number of deaths is estimated to be over 1,000. 
 The protest, initially led by students, has now garnered widespread support from the general public. In the wake of the mass killings, students demanded nine points, including justice for the deceased and accountability for the forces who shot and the ministers who authorized the violence giving them the order of ""shoot at sight"". These demands were denied. The singular demand now is for Dictator Hasina to step down.

 Change some traditional customs and be more affluent and open.  
 
 Yes.  If you ask people they will say ""no we will not change but we will become more affluent"" but they are wrong.  Pakistan is a very dynamic society and it has changed a lot.  The Pakistan of the 1970's is totally different than the 1980's and the Pakistan of the 1990's was a different world.  Pakistan today is going thru many cultural and societal and religious changes. 
 
 The Chinese now generally believe that Muslims will not change and that any attempt to adapt to modern society is considered blasphemous . 
 
 This is really eye opening. I never heard this from any of my Chinese friends.  I would say it is short sighted to think this way.  Muslims are not some monolith group like the Borg from Star Trek.  A Muslim from Algeria or Tunisia has very different ideas than one from Bangladesh or China or Egypt. 
 Lenin said something a long time ago that I think is very insightful. He said Muslims view their culture as Islam.  I will try to find the exact quote but I think he was very insightful when he said that.  But also understand that Muslims are a very young group of people worldwide (especially in Pakistan and Egypt and the Arab world) and young people today are not interested in the past.   
 
 any attempt to adapt to modern society is considered blasphemous . 
 
 Not true at all.  Muslims do lots of modern things like go to university, work in high tech companies, use the banking system and such.  Sure Muslims might dress different but that really is more a cultural thing and you will find Muslims as modern as anyone else in the world.   
 
 The Hui in Yunnan went to other ethnic groups' homes to ban alcohol , Because their faith forbids alcohol . 
 
 I think some Muslims do go overboard on things related to personal responsibility.  I feel that it is less likely Muslims will do these type of things in the future.  I think anyone can be too enthusiastic about their belief system. 
 
 1850-1860, While China was in civil strife, muslims in Shaanxi rebelled and massacred other ethnic groups nearby in an attempt to establish a Muslim theocracy.

Reddit,I am a Chinese. Can I ask some questions about your people?,Changretta,"1, Around the year 1260 , an ancient Chinese dynasty was about to be conquered by the Mongols. A Muslim family killed the emperor family who had come to flee. The Muslim family took refuge in China . The emperor of this dynasty had given them a fief and helped them settle there . This is seen in China as an example of Muslim betrayal .  
 
 Could you name the emperor who died or the muslim family in question? But thanks for sharing, it's important to understand better that historical event, especially if it's still relevant to the Chinese perception of muslims.  
 I do feel it's stupid of your people to let your perception of the whole 1.8 billion muslim population  be affected by some event over 700years ago from your own soil,  that had nothing to do with any of the muslim countries or religion in itself. But well, can't blame you for not knowing much about the world. 
 ​ 
 
 I would like to ask, are these behaviors of Chinese Muslims normal?   
 
 You've described a behavior that would be considered extremist. Pretty sure doesn't apply to all Chinese muslims either. Unfortunately, almost all muslim countries have their extremists (violent or non-violent), but rest assured, they're a minority. We are all dealing with them somehow, through education, patience and without persecuting whole populations. =)

Reddit,I am a Chinese. Can I ask some questions about your people?,ZakoottaJinn,"But I think social governance needs realism. 
 
 I agree but also look at Islamic history through the lens of realism. 
 Modern China is notorious for suppressing cultural and religious practices of different groups of people in an effort to achieve a greater common good decided by the politburo of the Chinese 
communist party. Which is driven purely by its desire to achieve the ideological end of socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
 Should that be seen as impediment to having stronger ties?  
 To answer the overall question of your post I think it’s possible for there to be compromise between two distinct ideologies if both sides make the continuous effort to assimilate and accommodate.  
 Which is essentially what realist social governance is all about, reaching a consensus that ensures the stability required for a prosperous society. 
 I think Pakistani Muslims are willing to assimilate to and accommodate with new ideas, and territories, and peoples, as long as its in the interest of making the region more stable and prosperous. 
 Like most Pakistanis wouldn’t want more land than Kashmir because that would cause more conflict and we wouldn’t compromise on certain foundational principles of our identity.

There have been multiple news outlets who have went to Xinjiang, access to the concentration camps are restricted, heavy military surveillance is implemented and whenever they are given access they show only a fringe group of people from these camps to put on a show as if they're 'educating them'.  
 There have been countless testimonies by people have have escaped the region, extradition orders by the CCP have been given out to countries like Kazakhstan where a majority of them have escaped too, also to Pakistan which has a small community of Uyghurs. 14 students and 9 other Uyghurs were extradited from Pakistan, sadly we're to weak to deal with the Chinese on these matters.  
 Also, Hui Muslims are not at the end tail of persecution because they're already assimilated into Chinese society, not because they're Muslim. On the other hand Uyghur people have a different tradition and culture along with Islam as their predominant religion. The CCP implemented these concentration camps in an effort to eradicate those who don't hold the same beliefs as them and indoctrinate people into Chinese culture. This is straight genocide.

Reddit,I am a Chinese. Can I ask some questions about your people?,deleted,"At the risk of being downvoted to an oblivion here is my personal view with as much redaction as possible of my biases against Islam. 
 
 
 Are these behaviour common? 
 
 Yes and no. Islam is much more than a religion its also a political system and as such it dictates through sunnah ~and precedence set forth by the caliph~ in regards to how people should behave and this policement of morals has been a thing. That being said muslims aren’t a monolith every pocket of their community cherry picks there own stuff. The behaviour you described is extremely common in muslim communities in UK and most of them are Pakistani even though you wont find the sharia police in Pakistan hitting up liquor stores or harassing people that are buying it. It is important to find the kind of narrative the imaams of these communities are pushing. That is mostly where the problem lies. 
 
 Whether the Pakistanis are willing to accept more territory ? 
 
 There is no push by the government or the people for any such thing 
 
 Will accepting large areas of territory and people destabilize Pakistan?   
 
 Yes 
 India and Pakistan have been engaged in proxy wars for a long time and there already are separatist movement as is adding in more territory will only exacerbate the situation  
 
 Change some traditional customs and be more affluent and open. 
Do you think most Pakistanis are willing to do that? 
 
 Like somebody else pointed out, Pakistan of today is drastically different from what it was 50 or so years ago. Getting people hooked on religion is much more easier than getting people off it and to accept a secular notion of state where the state does not care about your preferred religion. 
 Also in regards to what another user said about Pakistan being created as a religious state, that is not true atleast not when it comes to Muhammad Ali Jinnah wanted Pakistan to be a secular state where religion doesn’t matter. He was against the creation of a separate state instead he wanted minorities to be represented but when the congress party pushed policies that would favour hindus, he pushed for a separate state where these same ideals could be realised.",-2 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/hcmpjc/i_am_a_chinese_can_i_ask_some_questions_about/

Through practice and time you become used to slinging correct amounts of spices into the dish at correct moments and that eventually becomes whats called 'restaurant quality'. 
 Funny enough my mom showed me the difference between restaurant cooking and the food she makes. She makes bomb food but it has more attention and is cooked slower and with a bit more care while as in restaurants it's large vats with fast cooking and throwing of spices.",6 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/m5yqxp/my_first_very_american_attempt_at_homemade_chole/

Also the variety of tomatoes and onions used, and the point at which you add the spice mixes makes a difference to the end-result flavour as well.     
 Not sure which recipe you followed. Did you add any saunf (Fennel)? I too like my curries masaledar (spices, not hot). So When I make tomato-onion based curries, I usually cook it in an open pan with basic spices, till it loses about 70-75% of the water content. That concentrates the flavours a lot. Only then I'll add the stock/water and then add some more masala powders so it doesn't burn.

Reddit,My Egyptian Embassy Experience in Islamabad,walee1,"I'll tell you another tale, when I was applying for a German study visa, I saw that I could go to the Lahore consulate to get a few documents attested instead of going to the German embassy in Isb. It was a requirement and costed 5k back in the day, forget what it was. So I booked an appointment, and went to the consulate. The whole staff there is Pakistani, including the counselor. Anyway while I was waiting, the secretary comes out, asks for my name, and when I tell him, he starts to yell at me like how I am late. I was half an hour early. I remain calm and tell him that no I am not late. He lets me into the second office, and then in comes the counselor, only to start yelling at me how I am trying to cheat the system as my appointment was already filled and he signed the documents already. So I'm more perplexed as I was definitely not there. Because the consular is literally abusing me and not letting me get a word in, I just go outside and ask the secretary again in a calmer manner wtf is going on. It turns out there were 2 people with the same first name who had scheduled an appointment. And apparently somehow that was my fault that I shared the first name with someone who already was there. I was so exasperated, I just got my documents and left. Went to the embassy in Isb, did the song and dance like you mentioned and went home with signed documents. To this day I'll say that the German counselor in Lahore is a sob, who really needs to be thrown out of his position.

 Here is the criticism you people refuse to accept. You say the shuttle services do not represent the embassy, then why do they act like they know it all?

Reddit,My Egyptian Embassy Experience in Islamabad,Yushaalmuhajir,"Bro the western poverty porn youtubers rarely have anything negative to say about Pakistan besides a few negative experiences that anyone will have in any country.  But I’ve not seen a single one of them that liked Egypt.  Egypt is worse when it comes to sexual assault, scams and its extremely xenophobic (the government is at least).  These guys literally aide Israel in the Gaza blockade.  They’re the result of militant secularism and Arab nationalism, young guys praying in the masjid at fajr end up in dungeons, men growing out their beards end up in dungeons and anyone remotely saying something that could be somewhat construed as something critical to the government will land you in a dungeon.  The Egyptians back home that went to my masjid would shut down the moment you brought up politics or history that wasn’t at least two thousand years old.  They had a real democracy for like a year and now they are back to the same tyranny but with a different tyrant and worship some Firaun who lost every war with Israel he started (or Israel started) despite having Soviet backing and outnumbering the Israelis by insane proportions (and mind you this was before the US started really throwing money and weapons at Israel).  
 If I were to ever call a country a shithole it would be Egypt.  My dad spent about 6 months in Egypt for military reasons and the only positive experience he had was joining a group of archaeology post-grads going into the pyramids and some off limits tombs.  I’ve shown him videos of Karachi (the not nice areas) and he told me Cairo was worse.   
 Tbh as much as I hate to say it, since I’d love to see the pyramids one day, I wouldn’t set foot in Egypt any time soon.  Check out Tunisia and Algeria if you wanna see some ancient Carthaginian, Roman, Germanic Vandal, Arab, Berber, French etc history.  Algiers looks identical to Paris minus the main sites in Paris everyone goes to see, and at least Algeria that I know of (I have a good bit of friends from there), there are very well preserved Roman ruins and people there who appear religious outwardly actually are religious versus the show offy type of religious a lot of folks here are (ie religious on the outside but terrible person on the inside).  The food of the Maghreb is absolutely amazing, the people are amazing (they have modern minds but traditional hearts if that makes sense).  I mean of course it’s also a developing country so you’ll have the typical problems we have here for tourists, but I highly recommend it if you’re still planning on going for holiday and haven’t picked a destination out.  
 TLDR:  Egypt sucks, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia are better, especially Algeria.  They’ve fought a war of independence and a civil war in the past 50 years yet now they’re a regional power, which is hugely impressive.  Almost everyone in my age group and younger speaks English and/or French along with Arabic as the lingua Franca. 
 Edited:  forgot to mention coastal Algeria is green and has very pleasant weather.  It’s very mountainous and looks like a cross between Kashmir and Scotland.

 You are definitely out of your mind if you think that is what a middle class marriage costs in Pakistan. I got married last year and the expenses were under 15 Lac including everything!!! Yes i was smart with not spending on stupid events but still even if did all of that, it still would have been 20 lac maximum 
 45 LAC (15k euro) is luxury for upper middle and upper class. NOT MIDDLE CLASS. and i am speaking from experience 
 
 Is saving this much for a junior software engineer hard, not really, I am a software engineer in Berlin so this much I know. But if you can’t afford 20k as meher you certainly can’t afford a wedding or to start a family and shouldn’t be getting married. 
 
 If you cant afford a mahar that the girl is demanding than find another one is what i would say. Not having 20k is definitely not a criteria for not getting married. I got married in less than one third of the amount you think is necessary to get married. Its about what two people agree on for sure

That's life kiddo, sooner or later you need to jump off, take the leap of faith and experience life. Yes it can be daunting at first but nothing good in life comes easily ever. You will have a hard time adjusting for the first few months but trust me it will pass and you will adjust to it.  
 I've been living alone doing every single thing on my own,from studying to working part time to working full time and managing every single aspect of my life by myself. Plus living in a society where English isn't the first language. I speak the language of the land and even did my bachelor's degree where 70% of my courses were taught in that language.  
 If people tell you not to be scared then they are lying honestly. Being scared is a natural response to the unknown which lies ahead but honestly that's the beauty of it all. You never know what is waiting for you ahead. It's Canada, you'll find people from the subcontinent there and definitely you'll adjust, you'll build a community of people who will help each other out to do stuff, teach you and thanks to the internet every single information is in your palms. Most of us are ready to doomscroll but won't open up YouTube to learn how to stitch and sew.  
 So buck up and congratulations on getting an admission in Canada. I wish you the best and pray you make it. You got this ❤️

Reddit,How do you deal with living abroad?,Liverpool1900,"You're smart to understand this now vs once being in the country. Do the following: 
 Learn how to cook basic dishes like daal, rice, chicken curry and if youre feeling ambitious a biryani. Itll teach you a lot of techniques required in desi cooking such as browning the onions, when to add spices, how much to add etc. learn to cook also with premade spice mixes like Shan. Very useful and no need to measure. Watch YT videos.  
 Learn how to clean dishes. What I mean by that is effectively and cleanly. How do you soak dishes and when do you use the dishwasher or not. Watch a YT video on how to load dishwashers. They are a time saver for sure and very prevalent in Canada.  
 Learn to iron your clothes. This is maybe the most important. It makes you look good and do them immediately after washing the clothes. Learn to use a washer and dryer. Use cold water since it won't damage your clothes and in Canadian weather your clothes dont get as dirty due to the air being cleaner so less dust etc stuck on it.  
 Learn to manage your time. Keep an entire day aside in the beginning to clean your living spaces and do grocery. If youre feeling ambitious and energetic do some meal prep too. I usually listen to podcasts and my entire day is both fun and productive.  
 Buy a Panini press from Walmart. Very cheap and easy to use. Makes sandwiches taste 10x better and tortillas will become your new found favourite.  
 Learn the basics of cooking eggs. Very versatile. And even premade marinades are a time saver.  
 Learn to keep track of things. Schedule your calendar on your phone for calling banks, doing taxes, getting sin etc. do not be forgetful neither do you have to if you utilize your phone technology well.  
 Learn how to compromise. If you live in dorms its a very nice skill to have. If you clean someones dirty dishes once it creates an instant bond. Doing something for others doesnt mean you do it everyday but youll showcase yourself as courteous and be considerate of others. 
 Also please idk about your hygiene but be very very mindful about this. I cannot stress this enough. Use deodorant everyday. Take showers on time. Keep your clothes clean and dont let them smell unwashed or of spices. Do not keep your winter jacket on the shelf right next to kitchen.  
 Always carry 50 dollars cash in small to medium denominations. Keep some in your phone cover. If you lose your wallet you have that money.  
 Keep track of your money. The currency conversion plays tricks with your mind.  
 DO NOT GET A CREDIT CARD RIGHT AWAY. Use debit for first 6 months. Get a feel for it and always treat your credit card like cash. Only spend if you have the money in chequing. 
 Pay your bills on time. It will affect your credit scores. 
 Join each and every club you can in university. You dont have to attend all the events but be social. Trust me its 50 percent of the foundation for your future. 
 Be kind and say hello, please, thank you etc. thank the bus driver always. Thank the tim Hortons employee. Be courteous and represent the best that you can be.

Reddit,How do you deal with living abroad?,potato-breath,"Hello lil padawan, 
I did the same journey six years ago. Though for me it was much easier as i was always a handy person.  
 But here is a starter pack.  
 1)  Health is wealth. Know your meds and remember to keep eating when you are sick, even if it's tomato soup with bread. You need food to get better.  
 2) Learn how to make some quick dishes. Omelettes are very versatile. Sandwiches. Learn how to marinate chicken, you can keep some pieces for almost 3 days in the fridge. Just pop them in the oven. Cause no one wants to spend 3 hours cooking after a long day. Also cooking skills are attractive for girls.  
 3) Laundry is easy but keeping your room tidy is important. Your room reflects who you are. 
 4) Have a small tool kit.  
 5) Youtube it.  
 Take this as an opportunity to grow and learn. Believe me you are gonna love this independence. Just don't forget your roots. 
 You will meet people of all walks of life. Your perspective on life is gonna change. Remember to have boundaries not everyone who is nice isn't your friend. Differentiate between friends, colleagues and acquaintances. Having a good friend circle is important, you can choose what kind people you wnt to be surrounded with.  
 When your clueless and have no idea. Remember your family has your back and a call with mom and dad or family can change the trajectory of your day.

 You don't have to justify anything, the situation is pretty clear. I see students in your situation a lot as first time hostelites from well off families that don't know anything even basic like for example for laundry when do you use cold water vs warm water vs op for handwashing. It's just frustrating to see brown families not teach their kids (mostly men don't get taught this) basic life skills to live while Japanese kids are made to clean their classrooms everyday. It's more than life skills it's a process of teaching the kid discipline, teaching responsibility, hardwork, teaching delayed gratification instead of having everything handed on a platter at a moments notice. Many scientific studies prove these things. Some may even say those from less well off households that actually know how to survive without mama and papa holding their hand are more privileged than the giant babies in nice clothes from expensive colonies that just look and talk good but can't tell a mop from a broom.

Reddit,Traveling to Japan,Pakistani_in_MURICA,"I would suggest picking 2 cities to have a hotelroom or ryokan. Hotels maybe expensive and have capped people/room rules. Then doing day trips out to others using the JR Rail (calculate if it's beneficial), before you get on each train you do need to reserve a seat. JR passes can also be used around Tokyo, this does not require reservation. 
 For activities every attraction/ Museum/ Shrine have an entry fee. Which attraction is your choice but I recommend: 
 
 Kyoto:

 
 Kinkaku-ji $, Ryoan-Ji $, Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, Kyoto Imperial Palace $, Tsujiri tea House $, Gion Philosopher's Path, Nishiki Market 
 
 Osaka:

 
 Osaka Castle $, Sinsekai Market, Rikuro’s Namba Main Branch for Cheesecake, Nintendo & Pokemon Osaka 
 
 Hiroshima:

 
 Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park & Remembrance, Miyajima Island $, Mt Misen $ 
 
 Tokyo:

 
 Ginza Six (imagine NYC 5th Ave), Mt Fuji & Lake Yamanaka $ (separate train ticket that also need to be reserved, the trains are also not on time), Imperial Palace $, Tokyo Tower (pictures of it). 
 
 
 Food can be relatively cheap if you're fine with  7-11, Lawson, or Family Mart. Each Ramen bowl or sushi meal will cost you no more than 1,900 Yen. Travel with a reusable water bottle and snacks, any chance you get to throw garbage do throw it. 
 Get a good camera or camera phone that can take pictures at night. 
 Follow Japanese influencers on IG: navito halal, Yamatrips, Japan explores, etc 
 Make an account on Wanderlog and pin locations you see that you're interested in visiting. The app is integrated with Google map's public transit routes so it'll be easy of you to optimize each day's excursion.

You can use booking.com to check accommodation prices. I would suggest not to stay in touristy areas and concentrate on stays with a metro station nearby.  
 Travel between cities using the Shinkansen and use a JR calculator to determine if you need a JR pass. I didn’t buy it.  
 At the end of the day a budget really depends on your needs and preferences. Most attractions you have to book in advance so you can see how much they cost. They’re generally cheaper than US and Europe but food can get expensive. 
 If you use Google Maps to check the directions to your intended activity from your accommodation it’ll give you cost for a metro trip as well. It should be a good guide for you.",10 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1mn8zp7/traveling_to_japan/

 You will find a lot of Transgender people in Pakistan, they can even have ""third gender"" written on their passport instead of male/female. I believe that is the legacy of the mughal era when eunuch were common. Nowadays if you look around Instagram you will find a lot of ""shemale"" advertising their services... 
I have met with a certain amount of them as well as several gay person, none of them will be saying openly in public but sometimes it is very easy to tell and i have a feeling that for the most part, nobody cares, as long as it stays in private. I might make a video about this later on but it is a touchy subject and i don't want to get those people in trouble as, indeed, religion is also very important here and there might be repercutions.

 You're right, most people don't realize that. I didn't realize that for a while but the many years of research done on conversion therapies showing how they don't work and just push the victims to depression, drug abuse and suicide which just goes to show how undeniable this fact is. The new argument coming out from the other side is:  yea okay we admit you can't change the fact that you're having erotic thoughts about the same gender but you should take this as a test from God and try your hardest to suppress those thoughts and not act on them . Which I guess is a slightly more sensible approach to it. 
 
 Making homosexuality illegal doesn’t decrease the amount of homosexuals 
 
 True. I'd argue it increases the number of homosexuals when paired with repressed heterosexuality. Atypical from the classic leftist opinions I do think there are situations where people can become homosexual who weren't born that way initially. An examples would be being locked in a male only environment where this is no other outlet for sexual frustration. We see this scenario in Pakistan as we talked about but we also see it in american prisons (and probs other countries too) where homosexual activity is higher inside the walls than the population outside the prisons. A lot of prisoners talk about becoming gay only when they went to prison. This is a topic of it's own that I could go on for a while lol. Sadly I don't see this point talked about enough sadly.

 That said, I live in the most liberal city and interact with the most “educated”, progressive people and even then the general consensus is that gays are bad or should be sent to asylums. (I don’t want to go into graphic details about the hate crimes my queer friends have faced- it’s graphic)

Reddit,Why China is not a preferred travel destination for Pakistanis?,astanoli,"Analysis of the thread by AI summarized it to following 5 main reasons:
Here are five reasons why China is not a popular travel destination for Pakistanis, based on the provided Reddit thread:
1.
China is not perceived as a tourist destination. Many people in the thread note that China markets itself as a manufacturing hub, and people generally go there for business rather than pleasure. Pakistanis tend to prefer shopping or destinations popularized in Western media.
2.
There are concerns about the availability of halal food. Several users express that it might be difficult to find halal food in China. One user claims that, while it may be difficult to locate at first, many cities have halal shops and restaurants.
3.
There are concerns about a language barrier. The language barrier is cited as a major obstacle for Pakistani travelers to China, as few Chinese people speak English. One user who lived in China for five years said that tourist infrastructure is designed to accommodate non-Chinese speakers only in major cities.
4.
The visa process is seen as difficult and expensive. Several users complain about the difficulty and expense of obtaining a tourist visa for China. One user claims that a state-appointed translator is required to drive to China, costing an additional $5,000 USD.
5.
There are negative perceptions of China stemming from Western media and concerns about the treatment of Muslims. Some users believe that Pakistanis are influenced by Western media portrayals of China. Additionally, the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China is mentioned as a deterrent for some. One user who lived in China for over a decade claimed that Chinese people generally look down on brown people and that China is not Muslim-friendly in terms of food, community, or services.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1g564nk/why_china_is_not_a_preferred_travel_destination/

First of all, the pool he had was girls aged between 29 and 40, and anyone with a good profile had really unreasonable expectations/demands. So, eventually, he had to settle for someone who wouldn't be one of his first choices. Had he been serious about it pre-30, the story would have been much different.

 majority of the unmarried girls here cannot do what you suggest. they cannot travel the world (half of them don't even have a passport or NIC), meet new people (kahan se new people milnay jab ghar se koi bahir janay nahi deta), or stay busy beyond the typical char dewari. if you've seen girls in 12th grade crying, imagine how their families are pressuring them even at that young age. so many families consider their girls a burden even in this era and are eager to marry them off as soon as possible. blame the culture here, and not the girls who are trapped because of it.",9 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ff5w5y/people_losing_sanity_after_not_getting_married/

 As for the mix-up of jobs and marriage, it appears OP is merging two fundamentally different aspects of life. While both undeniably influence one’s experience, they operate on separate planes. A job is primarily a personal and professional decision that relates to career development and financial stability. In contrast, marriage is often in Pakistan entangled with societal and cultural expectations, which can profoundly impact one's opportunities and personal choices.

Reddit,People losing sanity after not getting married,shehzore12,"The below comment is from  Enough_Tart_235  in this same post in reply to OP. It explains my position really well. 
 Are you a secular guy? 
 I don’t see a problem with women wanting to get married early. The only way to have halal intimacy is through marriage, be it emotional or physical. Guess what, the westerners do all that since they’re 11-12. Only difference is they do all of that outside of marriage. Nothing wrong with women not wanting to work and get married early. You also have to realise that women are on a biological clock and most guys prefer marrying younger girls. And girls often like guys older than them. 
 My wife is educated with a masters degree but she doesn’t want to work. It’s a man’s duty to provide and my wife is happy to take care of the house. That’s the case with majority desi and Muslim women. You need to understand that men and women think differently, a man takes honour in providing and protecting his wife and a woman loves to take care of the house and children. That doesn’t mean women can’t work….. in fact in certain fields like education and healthcare especially we need women to cater for fellow women. 
 But by instinct a woman desires to be provided for by her man. I live in the west and let me assure you a lot of working women here are depressed. Eventually they all hate the corporate lifestyle that they initially craved for. Their whole feminist dream turns out to be a lie, no children, can’t dedicate time to family because after work she has to take care of house chores and doesn’t have time for her husband and children who are raised by strangers at a day care. 
 Again nothing wrong with women working but by default women since the beginning of times have been homemakers that’s their instinct and you can’t change that no matter what extreme the liberal media goes to. 
 In one of the comments you go on about equality? Let me make this clear men and women can’t be equal no matter how much your influenced by woke culture. Allah created us different physiologically. Only in terms of religious commitment we’re equals. We are both better than and worse off the opposite gender in many things. 
 So if women want to work good for them, the ones that don’t and are happy to get married and not work let them be. Who cares about inflation, as a man you gotta work hard. I personally don’t think it’s manly to ask my wife to contribute to household expenses.

Reddit,People losing sanity after not getting married,deleted,"I have had educated friends who were pursuing medical studies at some of the best institutions in America who were really eager to marriage alongside their career goals to the point they laughed at me for not showing too much interest in it. I think it’s not even just a choice between education and marriage but some people want that “perfect” life that includes having the best education and having what they consider is a settled life (that they don’t realize can happen when you’re single too) with an ideal life partner. It’s not even amongst Pakistanis tbh. I see so many 30+ women even who aren’t desi who are disappointed that they’re not living the life they imagined in their 20s and that includes getting married and settling down. I personally believe it’s best to be single than be married to the wrong person and I even tell my friends I’ve accepted if I never find the one. But I do think these things deserve some nuance, I mean you can be happily single, independent and can be content with it but sometimes you want fulfilling relationships in your life-can be an understanding partner, friends or ideally both. For me, I have always been more eager to have a close group of friends rather than focusing on finding a partner, but sadly I haven’t really had great friends in my life and at an adult age am finding it harder to make new ones. The thought of going back on apps is agonizing so I’m just freestyling I guess haha.",3 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ff5w5y/people_losing_sanity_after_not_getting_married/

 I am in my 30s alhumdulillah. I take care of myself. Have a proper diet plan, go to gym, have a bangin bod, Have pets that i would give and take a life for. Have my family and they are extremely, extremely supportive of my life choices. My life is actually good. Better than most people i know. And no.. money is not the factor. I think its my family's respectful attitude.  
 I have never been in any physical relationship with anyone and dont ever intend to in sha Allah. Sex isn't on my priority list tbh. Even most of married ladies i know are sexually frustrated and unfulfilled by their husbands who cant seem to understand female pleasure. 
 I decided not to get married when i was 19 cuz i dont wanna ""obey"" a man. I am extremely private and introvert person and just the thought of sharing my space with a man makes my skin crawl. Most men around me are worthless and repeated abusers. 
 Also.. i am not that fond of kids. I wanna put myself first. Not a crying, leaking, annoying little germ that i have to push out risking all my organs and health. Eww, just eww. 
 As for the other ladies around me.. including my sisters, cousins, friends, all regret marrying and since divorce is not an option, they have decided that if they ever go to jannah, they will leave their current partner asap and get a new one. Since its jannah, anything is possible, right? 
Their husbands regularly beat them, cheat on them, financial abuse is rampant..

Reddit,People losing sanity after not getting married,Nocturnal_Nymph_,"Hi! I get where you're coming from, but the points OP is making are offensive because they completely minimize the struggles faced by women here. In Pakistan, the situation is very different from what you might experience in Europe. Girls here often grow up being told they are already engaged to someone much older, and by the time they are 16-18, they are often married off. While they are supposed to be focusing on school and navigating puberty, they're also expected to learn how to manage a household. 
 Once married, a woman here isn’t just a wife, btw.  She's expected to take care of the husband, his parents, and sometimes even extended family. If she fails at this, domestic abuse can be a very real consequence. it's a big issue in Pakistan (with statistics showing a high prevalence). And when OP talks about girls wanting to 'just get married and do nothing,' it's dismissive of the reality. For many women here, marriage is far from ‘doing nothing.’ It means raising children, managing the household, and often taking on the role of unpaid domestic help. 
 This issue is not unique to Pakistan, it reflects broader South Asian cultural norms. If religion were the issue, you'd see similar problems in India, where the majority is Hindu. Women there also face similar pressures and cultural expectations. The problem lies in outdated cultural norms rather than religious teachings. Women in South Asia, including Pakistan, are judged no matter what they choose!!!!! Those who prepare for marriage are labelled as 'want to do nothing in life,' and those who are career-oriented face backlash for not conforming to traditional expectations. OP’s views come across as deeply misogynistic and dismissive, ignoring the real challenges and cultural pressures that women face every day. It's not about 'fantasies' but about navigating a toxic culture that restricts their choices at every turn.",4 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ff5w5y/people_losing_sanity_after_not_getting_married/
Reddit,People losing sanity after not getting married,Nocturnal_Nymph_,"I appreciate your response, but it seems like you’re missing some crucial points. The idea that educated families wouldn’t force early marriages doesn’t align with the reality in Pakistan. The education system here is in shambles, around 22 million children are out of school, and many who do attend struggle with poor quality education. This systemic failure affects everyone and isn’t just a matter of personal choice. 
 It’s also worth noting that your comments about “especially girls” and their supposed focus on marriage seem quite dismissive. You're blaming women for their situation without acknowledging the systemic issues at play. This isn’t about individual failings but about navigating a broken system and oppressive cultural norms. 
 Your views oversimplify the problem and ignore the broader societal and structural issues that contribute to these challenges.",4 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ff5w5y/people_losing_sanity_after_not_getting_married/
Reddit,People losing sanity after not getting married,Nocturnal_Nymph_,"In the follow-up responses, you have softened your stance on blaming individuals, especially women, for their circumstances. Instead, you’re now focusing on the failure of society and parents to prepare individuals for challenging scenarios.

 The change in tone reflects a shift from a more judgmental view to one that acknowledges systemic issues and the need for better preparation and support for both genders.

Reddit,People losing sanity after not getting married,Low_Bicycle_3377,"A very small minority of people who decide to choose the path of apathy in the world, often suggest that perhaps we should go the other way and focus more on material gains than living for others, path of sacrifice, having a marriage, having kids, living for them, and more. Things that are greater than us.  
 Instead of going for a wise approach about the right things, we blame the right ideas because of our poor approach.  
 In this example, I would say not all worries are bad. Especially for women, they have a certain age beyond which they have pregnancy troubles. Men should also prioritize marrying as young as sensible.  
 In this country where people have a lot of dilemmas and reasons to be sad, one good thing is that many various worldviews can be seen applied in other societies. And so we can see the result of it there and perhaps not be misdirected.  
 The issue that is seen in many developed nations which have adopted these notions, is that we see miserable women and majority miserable men. Because the problem is that most people value things like bearing children having a partner in life who is your second half, much more than the temporary glitter of gold which is financial success.  
 I will be adding since I don't know what you imply by the phrase ""enjoy your life, meet new people"", people also have a system (which I believe God has made for married couple) where there are certain needs. If it is meant in that way, then it is observable that it only results in degeneracy and ruined lives. If it means as is, I guess I would say that people get tired of amusement parks and meeting strangers.  
 I do agree that no ""prince"" is going to come save you since marriage isn't the end of challenges but the start of a journey together where you have to grow old together and build a household. And yes, not every man it's going to be a crorepati, but if a man is known to work hard, he is a decent man. And that is also an important thing to realise in current times.  
 But lastly, I would say this that at the core, let's say hypothetically, in a dream scenario we are financially self sufficient with savings that account for any unpredictable events in life. We could say we work for the like satisfaction, to move around, not dull ourselves etc. But generally people work jobs. And reality is that working is labour, and labour is by nature of people something undesired. Since you complete a certain type of work whether you enjoy or not out of need not out of want.  
 People have limited time and energy in life. And also by the differences in the biological, between men and women. Men are much more suitable for work. Be it temperature maintenance of a body, simple strength, endurance, stamina, maternal leaves and more.  
 Then when you have kids, who will take care of the kids? Would you then look for daycares? Which ends up in the neglecting of children. Naturally mothers role is to take care of kids and father's is to earn and protect. They can decide if they want to stray from the natural way, however any other way would always be inferior. Because it all works well in our fantasies, where we don't have the reality of limited time, energy and ability.  
 TO CONCLUDE, I would say, building a household really is the ultimate individual goal apart to our duties to our family. So we should not make it our ""least priority"". We should be focused and prepare ourselves for it. Facing challenges should not make us hate our duties and purpose. Be it tough, facing the challenges is reality. Not approaching a hedonistic approach in life.",2 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ff5w5y/people_losing_sanity_after_not_getting_married/
Reddit,People losing sanity after not getting married,Enough_Tart_235,"Are you a secular guy?  
 I don’t see a problem with women wanting to get married early. The only way to have halal intimacy is through marriage, be it emotional or physical. Guess what,  the westerners do all that since they’re 11-12. Only difference is they do all of that outside of marriage. Nothing wrong with women not wanting to work and get married early. You also have to realise that women are on a biological clock and most guys prefer marrying younger girls. And girls often like guys older than them.  
 My wife is educated with a masters degree but she doesn’t want to work. It’s a man’s duty to provide and my wife is happy to take care of the house. That’s the case with majority desi and Muslim women. You need to understand that men and women think differently, a man takes honour in providing and protecting his wife and a woman loves to take care of the house and children. That doesn’t mean women can’t work….. in fact  in certain fields like education and healthcare especially we need women to cater for fellow women.  
 But by instinct a woman desires to be provided for by her man. I live in the west and let me assure you a lot of working women here are depressed. Eventually they all hate the corporate lifestyle that they initially craved for. Their whole feminist dream turns out to be a lie, no children, can’t dedicate time to family because after work she has to take care of house chores and doesn’t have time for her husband and children who are raised by strangers at a day care.  
 Again nothing wrong with women working but by default women since the beginning of times have been homemakers that’s their instinct and you can’t change that no matter what extreme the  liberal media goes to.  
 In one of the comments you go on about equality? Let me make this clear men and women can’t be equal no matter how much your influenced by woke culture. Allah created us different physiologically. Only in terms of religious commitment we’re equals. We are both better than and worse off the opposite gender in many things.  
 So if women want to work good for them, the ones that don’t and are happy to get married and not work let them be. Who cares about inflation, as a man you gotta work hard. I personally don’t think it’s manly to ask my wife to contribute to household expenses. Unless in exceptional circumstances when you’re struggling but ultimately as a man your life needs to be a struggle, else you never learn.

Reddit,People losing sanity after not getting married,Kind_Leadership3079,"Has anyone seen the drama, Malal? It’s very well-made. It used to be on youtube, so I recommend checking it out if it’s still there. 
 In the drama (Malal), you have a woman named Zeenia who is single and in her mid-30’s and she lives in the US. She is good friends with a man named Danish and after so many years Danish decides to visit his mother in Pakistan, but before doing so he tells Zeenia that he will tell his mother that he wants to marry Zeenia. Zeenia eagerly awaits in New York for Danish’s return. But back in Pakistan, Danish’s mom rejects Zeenia. Even though his mom has spoken to Zeenia on the phone (perhaps even on Skype/Facetime), she turns down the rishta. Mom tells Danish that Zeenia is “older” and we don’t know much about her back ground and that she has a better and “much younger” girl in mind for him. Danish gives up too quickly in his stand for Zeenia and surrenders to his mother’s wish in marrying a girl that is sooooooo much younger than him and not on the same wavelength as him either. There is a really nice ironic twist to the drama, even though (unfortunately) that twist is not a common occurrence in Pakistani society. It’s a good watch that I recommend. 
 ^  As I have said before, dramas are an art form and as the saying goes, “Art imitates life”. Art reflects the issues and trends and attitudes abd beliefs of a society. With that said, there STILL exist Pakistani mothers that will prefer and favor a MUCH younger bride for their 30-45 year old son.  So, that puts older (single) women at a disadvantage as well….as if they don’t already have other hangups going against them….right? 
 I’m going to share a TRUE personal story. The purpose of this story is to emphasize that while not all Pakistani guys have such a disturbing mentality, it DOES exist in our society. I am an older Pakistani single woman. Alhumdolillah I have not crossed the zina boundary; Allah ka shukar. Once I was speaking to a Pakistani guy who (it later turned out) had given the false impression of being single. The guy was a married father. He said to me, “There’s no way you can be a virgin. Tell me how far you’ve gone with a guy. Second base?” His tone was so disgusting. He assumed that just because I was “older” that I could not possibly have remained virtuous. Many Pakistani guys and even their parents will assume that an older woman and especially one that lives on her own may not be “pure” whilst forgetting that there is no guarantee that a much younger girl would be more chaste. 
 My late uncle’s eldest daughter was a very bright student who wanted to become a doctor. This would require his daughter to move to another city in Pakistan away from her home  to pursue medical studies. My uncle was against it because he feares that it would hurt her rishta chances because guys and their parents might assume his daughter is “too modern” or may have gotten up to no good whilst living away from home and her parents’ watchful eyes, etc. In the end it’s naseeb. It was not in her naseeb to become a doctor.

Reddit,Why are Pakistanis generally so conservative compared to other Muslims?,akskinny527,"I think the 'conservative' Islam in Pakistan is not the same as traditionally conservative interpretations within Islam (eg salafism, Hanbali school of thought etc).  
 My theory is that the subcontinent practices Islam that's been Victorian-era Christian influenced AND Hindu influenced. The treatment of women, of intimacy between spouses, of the family unit, the role of a woman in society... all of this can be traced to Christians and Hindus. Christians view intimacy as gross, they view female gender roles as 'divine' - so a housewife is literally doing worship when she cooks/cleans and anything deviating from that is sinful. Islam doesn't define relationships or gender roles like that, there is a preference... but it's def not divine law. How the family unit treats a woman in Pakistan is also very similar to Hindu culture/religion. The Quran explicitly mentions menstruation, yet we follow the weird Hindu notion that it's somehow impure/cannot be spoken about ever.

Reddit,Why are Pakistanis generally so conservative compared to other Muslims?,throwaway-ram,"Pakistani rulers understood a thing a long back. Hate is stronger emotion than love. Once you fill people with hate they will overlook ruling class problems and focus energies on subjects to hate. 
First in line were minorities (Hindus/Sikh/Christian)
Now its Muslims of different sect (Baloch/Ahmadi/Shias)
In future, it will be women (ban on education/women rights etc) 
 When you hate a person for his faith, you discard all his good qualities that can be used in service of nation. This is the reason a non-muslim person has not reached higher ranks of military or political party in Pak. 
 At one point in 1990, this hate was harvested to create expendable soldiers who would fight against Russians in Afghanistan. Ruling class got lot of money and political and military clout for Afghanistan deal and poor uneducated crowd lost their lives fighting a pointless battle.  But to reach that level they had engage in deep rooted propaganda at all levels of education system. Now the same propaganda permeates all levels of society.   
 Today, there is no common enemy but any political party that wants to come up in ranks harvests this deep rooted hatred of anything UN-Islamic. To cancel a leader/person it as easy as labeling him/her UN-islamic. 
 Sometimes hating on something that is considered a SIN in religion (like Alcohol) would give you prominence in political system and rally people around you. So it is now a clutch to rise into ranks. 
 There is no easy way out other than separation of religion and state. You can argue other countries like Saudi Arabia it is working well. But Saudi Arabia uses carrot and stick method. Its citizen are flush with cash provided by state and then citizens begrudgingly comply with harsh religious practices. Same thing with China, CCP is strict but it has lifted millions out of poverty and provided its citizen with much wealth and prosperity even while living under dictatorship.

Reddit,Here's a list of products from Israel and their alternatives.,fraggas,"I see your point, but these are businesses. Take this with a grain of salt because these numbers can be fake, but I find them pretty believable. According to a quick search I did a while ago, McDonald's Israel made more money in 2015 than McDonald's Pakistan in an unspecified year. Why would they pull out of there? If they have to make a choice, we're the ones to go. If international chains started pulling out of every country which ever violated human rights, they would have no business left. That doesn't make it right obviously, I'm just stating why from their pov it is impractical. 
 And it does hurt our economy, in both short and long term. I can't believe how you lot trust Pakistanis so much with being fair to the customers and the workers if they get a monopoly on a market, having experienced Pakistan yourself for a decent amount of time. For example, Gourmet would probably get a monopoly on the cola market if Pepsi left. Do you honestly believe they won't jack the prices up and keep the wages extremely low because they would know all the workers from the Pepsi factory who lose their jobs would have no choice? Add to that the fact that we'll be discouraging any foreign company from investing in Pakistan and then in the near future, asking ourselves why we're so far behind India economically. This is not small discomfort. This is uprooting our people's lives just to pat ourselves on the back and to feel like we're doing something for Palestinians because we can't make a real impact. 
 All that being said, buying these products is a choice. You don't need a reason to not buy these products. It's not haram to buy from people you're at war with and has been practiced by the companions of the Prophet (PBUH). So we shouldn't be judging people who feel like they cannot give these products up. The companies leaving carry real consequences, but if we as a nation make that free choice, I would be okay with it because we made that choice freely. I'm just not comfortable with people imposing their own choice and being judgy about others eating KFC and drinking Pepsi because they feel like virtue signalling.",9 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/17tw041/heres_a_list_of_products_from_israel_and_their/

 The intention is to hurt them, deglegitimize and provide pressure financially and to get the message across to stop aiding and performing genocide.

 Being cynical helps, but not to the point of ignorance. This movement in Pakistan is a part of the larger BDS movement, a Palestinian led movement, which first gained traction in the second Intifada.

 Boycotting products is a form of activism known as consumer activism. There have been multiple studies done in the past on the short and long run impact of boycotting and consumer activities. 
In the short run, it damages their profits. In the long run, it damages their reputation to an irreversible extent. The Danish companies boycotted during the late 2000s in Saudi Arabia never recovered as a result  
 There have been multiple studies published on both the short term and long term effects of consumer activism. You can access them on any resesrch database and see for yourself.

Reddit,"As a working woman, would you share half of your income for household stuff/related stuff?",Alternatiiv,"The comments on here are wild! Your expectations are realistic. You'd be doing the right thing by walking away from such people. 
 Marriage is supposed to be a partnership, companionship, not a glorified business transaction. You're looking for a companion, a partner, not a dependent. 
 Ask yourself, God forbid, what happens if you're fired, there's an accident, or something unfortunate like that? Will such a person stay and support you because you can no longer provide? 
 Yes, a marriage isn't always equal. Sometimes, one partner has to do more than the other, one partner contributes more financially, and the other gives more time, care, and emotional energy. Sometimes, one partner has to step up in all aspects. That all is normal. What's not normal is when one person enters marriage expecting to benefit without contributing equally to the shared future. 
 Follow this line of reasoning, it's really simple. 
 
 When one partner stays home, they manage the household, and family. That's full-time work, and equally valuable and demanding as a job if not more. There is an equal sense of responsibility and contribution to the marriage and the house. 
 When both partners work, they should share the chores. If one person chooses to not commit to the finances, then the other person ends up carrying double responsibility, with chores and work towards the marriage and the house, while the other's time and commitment spent towards a job serves only themselves. 
 
 Does that make sense? Now people will say a woman needs protection, that's true. Her protection realistically is the Mahr, and her career. Religiously, it is the Mahr, which is why there's no restriction on what she can ask for. 
 Now disclaimer, I don't care for religion much, but I know a few things. Some people like to invoke religion to insist that it is a man's obligation to provide. This is all true, and it is agreed upon by consensus. However, it is also agreed on by consensus that a man can ask his wife to not work and commit her time to house making. The dynamic in religion goes both ways, there are rights a woman has over her husband, and rights a man has over his wife. This should be kept in mind if religion is important to you. 
 The reason I bring it up is because anyone who invokes one aspect of the religion to their sole and lone benefit, while ignoring the other, are simply exploiting the religion for their own benefit, and manipulating you really. With one face they say that marriage should be done early in the twenties, while with the other face, they put up these expectations they know the vast majority of men in their early twenties can't fulfill because that is how the financial world is nowadays. They don't realize it, but they ruin the institution of marriage and make it reserved for those well off from the beginning. 
 To wrap it up, the woman isn't wrong from a religious point of view. But you're also not wrong, and religion doesn't prohibit you from that if you're looking for a woman with a similar mindset. This is just the reality of finances in this current time, and your concerns are genuine. So, don't let people twist your standards. They're realistic expectations, you're saving yourself trouble. Many people will have different preferences and standard, just keep looking, you'll eventually find one who's compatible.",88 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ogq73l/as_a_working_woman_would_you_share_half_of_your/
Reddit,"As a working woman, would you share half of your income for household stuff/related stuff?",Reasonable_Stress182,"Hi. Fellow match applicant in this years cycle and am a career woman have been earning my coin since 2019 and funded half my USMLE journey myself (I had help but I worked to pay off a chunk of it) here’s why I think the lady was 100% right and you will find it very very hard to keep another woman imbcz of your financial views: 
 
 this was Muzz I am assuming you are Muslim since it’s created for Muslims. It’s unislamic to ask her to do 50/50. Please this is a non negotiable. You are the provider whether you like it or not you have to pay for her and your expenses and the kids. She can spend on her house too but it counts as charity and is up to her discretion. If you aren’t Muslim (tf u doin in muzz?) skip this point.  
 women make 73 cents to ever dollar a man makes in the United States. Women physicians are still even in 2025 underpaid and face severe gender wage gaps. To ask her to do 50/50 as a dual physician heterosexual household is not accounting for the disparity in your wages. Are you both going to be hospitalists? Is she going into surgery and are you going into Paeds? You do understand wealth disparity exists between these fields? If she is say going to be a gen surg attending someday and you’re gonna be a paediatrican maybe a DEEPER conversation is to be had about finances later but that can’t be discussed now. If you haven’t lived in the US you have NO IDEA the financial stress you’re about to be put thru. If you already live there that’s a diff story I don’t know where u are.  
 here’s smt a resident in the US told us how he and his wife split costs. He is an IM resident and she is an interventional cardiology fellow they have 2 kids. This is a white couple who married young in a rural US town and made it big together though medschool. He plans to use his hospitalist salary to fund the family’s lifestyle for the next 20-30 years and pay for his kids education. His single income is gonna be enough to lead a more than comfortable life (300k+) meanwhile his wife who has done 2 fellowships by now will make upwards of 800k+ save and invest for retirement. Eventually after putting kids thru uni and saving up they can retire super early because of the wife’s money. Note: even here in this white peopke family the man is funding everything but the wife’s money is gonna keep them comfortable for retirement. It’s being saved. Qabar mein nahin ja rahi kisi aisey din ke lye rakhi ja rahi hai jab dono ke kaam ayi. Marriage isn’t just the here and now and day to day it’s a LONGGGG time. Be open to discussing how you are gonna support a woman first then ask her how she’d like to pitch in. You also didn’t give any details. 50/50 dono karogey you’re both gonna burn out and not be financially stable in the coming decades.  
 she absolutely deserves to do whatever she wants with money. It was 10x harder for her to get here than you. You don’t know what sick ailing parent she needs to support with her money, which siblings she needs to help get through college, who back home needs her. Women also have responsibilities at home or do men think we drop out of the sky to please them? Not acknowledging she has these is also a mistake. Utha ke 50/50 kyun daal dya uska mood hi off higaya bhai next time AVOID that term at all costs and don’t discuss finances until you’ve built some more common ground 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Reddit,"As a working woman, would you share half of your income for household stuff/related stuff?",Chicmuffin,"That's not what he said. A young woman approaching marriage is already anticipating having to go through multiple pregnancies and childbirths, and worried about keeping her job and her own income despite all this while a man ONLY has to worry about earning. Women earn less, are expected to sacrifice more, and now have to pay 50-50 too?  
 The bare minimum for a man is to acknowledge the contributions of a woman in marriage in the form of childcare and long periods of pregnancy. If he ascribes zero value to that, and thinks they're both pulling the same weight, he's not fit for marriage. He's not 'logical', just pure selfish and greedy. This guy just straight up told her that he wants her to contribute 50% of expenses while he has no ability to do 50% of pregnancy or the sacrifices that come with it. And then, he's blaming her for not initiating any negotiation? If you tell a woman she has to pay 50% isn't it sufficiently clear that you value only money, and that for you, carrying, birthing and taking care of babies is not 'valuable'/not worth even 1%?  
 Op has reiterated in multiple comments that ""women nowadays don't lose out on anything in their career because of babies"". What a joke! What world are you guys living in? By nature his wife has to put in 2x amount of effort to get to where he is. If she's still in the same position despite having babies it's because she has struggled more than a married man in the same position would have.

Also be so for real, almost all of the women of our grandmother's and even mother's generation were financially abused. Why is to so bad that a woman keep a small nest egg for herself?

Reddit,"As a working woman, would you share half of your income for household stuff/related stuff?",LeisurebyWHD,"Hello Miss Interstellar! Your username just reminded me of one of my most favorite movies. Anyways! As TARS says in interstellar "" Absolute honesty isn't always the most diplomatic nor the safest form of communication with the emotional beings"",  I think that's one of the mistakes we can't afford to commit in our times right now but I committed nevertheless.You have to understand that.  
 Our time is different from yours. When you got married, things were pretty simpler in the marriage market and generally men didn't have any other option but to take 100 percent responsibility in our traditional arranged marriage setup.same for the love marriage. 
 Try to see this from the perspective of Gen Z. The world economy is changing and getting more expensive; single house households are barely surviving, life is getting hard and AI is replacing many jobs and as doctors although we are safe from it for the near future but we never know what the future holds. It's very important for both partners to work and contribute nowadays. Now, how they contribute is something that can be discussed and agreed upon. That's from a technological and economical perspective and then from a human perspective, you have to understand that things don't work on trust nowadays. You have to discuss everything and agree on it beforehand. I don't think so I was wrong to have a very open discussion with her on finances. 
 I don't understand at what point in time it was decided that whatever husband does is obligation but whatever wife does is her choice and she can decide to do somethings out of love.
What you are saying that you do trips etc out of love are actually an unspoken necessity of your family. If you stop doing them then your husband will not be able to do them or if he does, he will not have any savings to carry out other long term financial goals. You were supposed to do them all along, just the label is different.
Still, you should ponder upon that isn't it a little bit unfair that your husband does most of the stuff and is on grind but you get off easily by buying a gift, paying for a once in a while trip and misc house expenses. Most of your money is still getting stacked. If you want to make some real contribution out of love then fulfill your family's long term financial goals with this untouched stack. 
 You should not be bringing incalculable and never proved stats like ""if both partners comprise equally then 90 percent of the time, wife gets the shorter end of the stick"" into the discussion. Stop playing the Women card. Women in lower tier households are still facing that problem but definitely not in the upper middle class and above. what if I say 90 percent of the men who are paying 100 percent into the household are getting exploited because they have to work the whole day and come back home and do even more work.  
 Definitely, pregnancy and childbirth are difficult but ""no amount of providing...... Comes close to what a woman goes through"" plz stop . If you compare the pregnancy+child birth of two to three kids to a lifetime of providing then you wouldn't be able to defend your argument. A life time is a long long long time.
And finally, I won't ask what a woman brings to the table if she also doesn't ask me the same question. 
 Btw, FYI red pill movement is quite extreme about it's views and it states that if you are providing 100 percent then there is no need for your women to go out. Keep them inside and let them raise kids and serve you.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ogq73l/as_a_working_woman_would_you_share_half_of_your/
Reddit,"As a working woman, would you share half of your income for household stuff/related stuff?",interstellar6624,"Thank you for being respectful unlike the other people to replied. I really appreciate it. 
 First of all, we're not that old, lol. We got married 4 years ago, currently in residency in the US, just turned 30. So we're in the same times. But I do acknowledge how messed up the economy is, and how difficult survival is. And knowing that, a couple of things are important. Firstly, we can't live like we used to in Pakistan, with maids, fancy clothes, going out frequently, huge weddings with gifts/jewelry/designer dresses, newest gadgets, luxury cars etc. We all should be decreasing our standards of living considerably if we want to survive on our own. If parents are financing, that's a separate thing. But its important to lower expectations of the quality of life, atleast while you're still training. The reality is, things will be hard, because of circumstances out of your control, so we have to learn to adapt.  
 Nonetheless I do agree that transparency is extremely important. Especially if you intend to marry a certain person. Expectations should be clear, but fair and realistic, and equal for both. Both partners have certain responsibilities, both partners can choose to go above and beyond their responsibility for love, and that is what I believe in. For example, according to Islam, it is a man's responsibility to provide, protect and maintain. This is a fact. It may seem unfair to you, but it is what it is. However, men are obligated to provide basic necessities only, the luxuries they provide, is done out of love, correct? Same case with women, they are responsible for guarding the home in their husbands absence but if they cook/clean or if they have a job, they can contribute financially, out of love. Do you understand my point now? Conflict arises when things that are done out of love, are manipulated into obligations, then the actual obligations are weaponized into a luxury that can be taken away. This is why labels are important. If I pay for trips back home, it is because I love my husband, and want to make his life easier. It might technically be a choice or a favour, but I choose to do it. That is the key to a successful and happy marriage. But also important to note, if for any reason I am unable to do so, it should not be held against me, the same way if my husband cannot provide luxuries, it shouldn't be held against him. Furthermore, it is not only trips I pay for, I pay for other stuff too, regularly, which results in me having the same amount at the end of the month, because I am being paid less in my residency than him. So I'm not stacking any extra money, everything is spent on our long-term goals which I'm not comfortable sharing online.  
 When I said that women get the short end of the stick, that is unfortunately the reality. I dont want to label all men as bad, because I'm Alhumdulillah married to a wonderful one, but I'm only stating what realistically happens. When you have 51% of the population below poverty line, 35%-45% in the lower middle-middle class, and only 10%-15% in the upper middle or above class, that is where the stats of 90% come in. You are only looking at the tip of the iceberg thats shiny and saying that bad things do not happen, when that is not the reality. There are hundreds, if not thousands of women in that 90% population, who work a full time job, do 100% of parenting, and 100% of household chores too, in Pakistan. That is the reality unfortunately. There are extremely few men who help with parenting and even fewer who help with household stuff. But yes, hypothetically, 90% of men who pay 100% of household, and come and do atleast 50% of chores and parenting, are being exploited and are getting the short end of the stick here, there is no denying that. But realistically thats not common at all in Pakistan is it? 
 As for providing vs childbirth. The statement i made is what happens in majority of households. That a man goes to his job, provides, come back, doesnt help in house or parenting, goes to sleep, rinse and repeat. Whether you like to admit or not, this IS the reality in majority of houses. And its not just only birthing 2-3 kids and youre done. Lets start from the beginning, the things that women have to go through alone, and men dont. Unsolicited invasive questions from family members, relatives (in most cases from the husband's side) about pregnancy, possible delay in conception and simultaneous judgement from those same people, getting pregnant, going through hyperemesis gravidarum, hormonal imbalance, hair falling out, gaining weight, constant invasive and disgusting comments from other people, gaslighting God forbid theres a chronic illness like hypertension or diabetes ('humne bhi tou bachay paida kiye hain'), GERD, inability to move, carrying upto 7-8kgs at all times, husbands demands for intimacy which she obviously cant refuse no matter if she feels miserable and sick, constant anxiety of the wellbeing of your child, finally at delivery going through the 2nd worst pain a human can experience (2nd to being burnt alive), epidural does not always work, or is feasible, or 'allowed', being exposed in front of sometimes 10 people with no ethics/morality, then post partum bleeding, pain, fatigue, hormonal imbalance again, taking care of another human being by yourself while youre barely making it through the day, lactation failure, again judgments and unsolicited comments from others 'humne bhi tou bachay paalay hain', lack of support from most husbands, never sleeping more than 3 hours because the baby needs to be fed for atleast 6 months like this, sometimes more frequent due to demand, a million diaper blowouts and vomits you have to clean yourself because most husbands cant be bothered, then physically having the baby tied to your hip all the time including the bathroom, and continuing this for the next 5 years atleast. Then if you have another kid, add the same list in addition to taking care of an active toddler, carrying the mental load of the house, the groceries, the cooking, school work, doctor appointments, continued judgements from other family members..... 
 I hope I am able to give you a glimpse of what happens. You can be delusional and deny it doesnt happen to rich educated women but it does and we're not even referring to them. So imagine this lifestyle, starting in your 20s, and continuing till those kids grow up, get educated, get a job, get married, get successful, probably when you're atleast 60, then maybeeee you'll be finally free but never rest because now you take care of your retired husband who cant even warm a meal himself. Compare this to working upto 10 hours a day, in a job in most cases you chose, where you are being paid, and after some time respected, with promotions, with dignity and praise from all those same relatives, applauded for making money (which you were gonna do anyway with or without wife) for 30ish years when you retire and can finally rest while your wife continues to serve you. Therefore yes, i still stand by my statement. No amount of providing money can compensate for what a women goes through in MAJORITY of marriages and childbirth and motherhood. So now you tell me, is it really ever 50/50?",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ogq73l/as_a_working_woman_would_you_share_half_of_your/
Reddit,"As a working woman, would you share half of your income for household stuff/related stuff?",sugarymess10,"I'm sorry but I never said/didn't mean to say that men’s contributions are lesser than. Or that the man owes everything to the woman in a marriage. What I meant to say was that certain sacrifices (like the physical, emotional, and social ones women often make) can’t really be “matched” in the same way financially or otherwise. That doesn’t mean men don’t sacrifice too; it’s just that their way is different. And woman can't match that. I'm pretty sure there's lots of worries and stresses that a husband would face daily in the way of his family, he'd have to sacrifice his wants and sometimes needs for the happines of the family too. But in this comment, I was talking from the woman's point of view.  
 And for the women who can’t or choose not to have children, obviously they still deserve love, respect etc. Being a woman isn't only about giving birth. The idea of being a provider for the family isn’t just built on the fact that women will give birth either, that was just stated as an example in most of the comments as that's something most women face and lose their careers over. A woman, in my opinion and from my experience, feels more secure when she knows that a husband will provide for her. If she doesn't want to work she doesn't have to, if she does she can but the idea of having to fulfill household expenses and worrying about that on top of everything else at least won't be a concern.  
 At the end of the day, obviously it depends on the couple. How they choose to divide their expenses is their business whatever works for them is good. OP isn't wrong for wanting 50/50 what he is wrong for is treating marriage like a transactional business and keeping track of the compensation one should be owed in return for literally doing the fardh of providing for his family.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ogq73l/as_a_working_woman_would_you_share_half_of_your/

There is no doubt,  the women are way more financially abused than men if they are working and I know and work with both women and men.
Also you saying that  what is this argument of women to be  taken care of. This comes from human nature. You can’t take that away from a woman.

 Marriage is transactional you like it or not, it has always been.You wont even pay for your children because its also transactional, why I pay for kids education and food I can love them without money 🤷

 You like it or not it is what it is. Sex is more important for men than woman theres a reason why female prostitution is more common than male prostitution 🤷 Many men literally get married for sex and children and women for financial support. This is how world works.

 Whereas men literally getting married for sex and children 🤷 why 'clock is ticking' 'young woman marriage' 'get married young' 'no marital rape' is the common concept in marital talks 🤷 
 You just don't want to acknowledge that. Its very simple. Its easier to call women prostitutes and crazy for money but as a man you wont even acknowledge how men literally benefit from marriage. And if prostitution is same as sex with wife then get married to prostitutes and go 50 50. Easy. 
 And if its about respecting choices then dont get worked up if women expect a provider mindset from men 🤷 
 If sex and kids is part of marriage so is being provider as men all 3 factors are natural part of marriage.  
 Stop shaming women if they expect men end of bargain if men expect sex and kids, you want your perks of traditional marriage but once its men turn it becomes prostitution. 
 Men having sex and kids is natural women having a provider is prostitution.Peak hypocrisy. You guys support men going 50 50 but if women say no to sex and kids in marriage it becomes dead bedroom right for cheating, women so selfish about their body wont give birth to children. In both cases man is a saint and woman is witch 🤷🤷 
 If sex and kids are not for men why men go for second marriage for sex and kids 🤷 why women are abused if they are infertile? why kids belong to men legally and if women are divorced they leave home not the guy. Why women leave their careers and parents home and adjust as per mens comfort in his city why not men leave their jobs and home and live with women? 
 In west 50 50 is a thing their marriage has entirely different laws, women do have x y z over there, men do leave jobs for women too, both look after kids and take a break from work, men are jailed for marital rape and abuse too.

Fortunately for us, we are both religious and practicing Muslims, Alhamdulillah. It was made clear right from the beginning of the process by him, that he will be the provider. The provider role is what makes us women respect our men and appreciate their efforts. Our brains are wired like this. All women deep down desire to be with a man with a provider mentality, irregardless of their religion and culture. Even if, for the sake of coming across as open-minded"" in modern days and being allowed to work, some women forgo and not admit this fact. 
 Now, what I do is, whatever money I have, I spend it on those necessities & luxuries, my husband forgoes at times for himself in order to provide for his family. I also spend it ofc on things I want which are outside the necessity (food/grocery). I also save it for emergencies. That being sad, I happily take over the role of a mother and managing the spending on the household, while he provides the financial means for all of this. The role of the woman is to take care of her children and husband’s need. It’s not necessarily equal to household chores, something Desis often misunderstand. Otherwise, wealthy women wouldn’t have any obligations towards their home. Taking care of your home means providing a peaceful, nurturing environment for your family on the foundations of Islam.

Reddit,"Husband and I disagree on the extent to which we should support his family financially, and it's tearing our marriage apart.",roXen09,"This toxic culture is common across many Pakistani households. Speaking from experience. What you need to do is set very clear monthly savings goals for yourself and your husband and do not compromise on those goals. Open a bank account specifically for this goal to track and set monthly and annual savings goals for yourselves.  
 Your husband’s priorities should be getting rid of the debt he has, not buying expensive rolex watches. He should of course take care of his dad if there are financial/health issues but randomly sending $2,000 to $5,000 monthly is going to backfire spectacularly because your husband’s siblings will put their claim on whatever money/property your father in law leaves behind.  
 Your brother-in-law is a leech. You are actually building very bad habits in him by reinforcing this “sabka ladla” complex. It looks like he is already extremely spoiled. He is going to expect to be handed things instead of working hard for them. He is going to use your husband as a crutch and won’t learn to stand on his own two feet. Best way to avoid this would be: build distance yourself and not just set but force the boundaries. For example, buy a minifridge and build a pantry within your own room for food items you don’t want him raiding. You have a young child so say you need to keep things close by when the child wakes at night so you don’t have to walk over to the kitchen. If needed, keep essential supplies hidden/out of view. Keep dinner and vacation plans to yourself. 
 Your situation is typical bullshit Pakistani family dynamics. When a time comes that your husband might need his siblings, more than likely his own siblings will abandon him and you as the wife will be the one left by his side. I am not just saying that. I have seen it time and time again across many families, including my own. Pakistani “sharikas” are the worst.  
 Another tip:  make a big investment like buying a house and let people know you no longer have the financial leverage you used to because of that investment. Never share how much income you actually have or how much you have saved up. 
 Don’t create needless drama around yourself because you will easily become target of hate.

If you didn't have a child, then sure, spoiling them from time to time and to a reasonable extent would've been acceptable.

 Your BIL is behaving like he's 15 years old but he's 25, a grown-up adult. Even I used to pester my siblings for snacks (I still do, hehe) but it's always within a reasonable limit and never extravagant unless they are providing by their own free will and unasked for. Even with the rich folks in my social circles, I occasionally accept snacks or outing, and nothing beyond that. I almost always refuse any expensive gifts or feel extremely guilty when they splurge on me, to a point where I feel miserable sometimes. And it's mostly given by their own accord and I didn't asked for it (I prayed for it sometimes though and only from my immediate family). 
 If I had a brother and SIL like you, I'd be one grateful brother for sure. But even I'd have enough shame to not make someone feel burdened and inconveniencing them, especially when they're not in a financially stable position and have an infant child to support.

 Sit dactar sahib down and communicate your concerns. Make sure to remind him about being a father to his child first, then a brother and son to his family. Of course he should help them out whenever he possibly can; but only within a fair range. Not to a point of negatively affecting your quality of lives and causing major hurdles down the road.

Reddit,"Husband and I disagree on the extent to which we should support his family financially, and it's tearing our marriage apart.",turkishegg,"You definitely  need to set boundaries, even with your father in law.
Firstly your brother in law needs to understand, you not a kid no more ,and these small traits will end up costing you everything ,especially  your marriage.Put your foot down hard and say no to his demands.
Your sister in law needs to stay out off your marriage and keep her business to her self.
Yes you do have a very good income between the  both of you,but now you have a child, their needs must be met ,childcare, schooling and etc.
Let your father in law know ,its okay we paying for your bills ,but you cannot dictate that we have to subsidised your brother in law.
Be polite but to the point,don't dilly dally around the subject.
Lastly your husband needs to know this cannot go on ,he needs to educate his younger brother to take responsibility for himself.
He wants 3-4 pizzas, than bloody well pay out off his own pocket.He wants to tag along on vacation, than tell him to chip in for the expenses. 
This joint family/sponging off elder brother has to stop.
You definitely  will regret it in the long run,if you don't put your foot down.
Good luck

Reddit,"Husband and I disagree on the extent to which we should support his family financially, and it's tearing our marriage apart.",Yushaalmuhajir,"I have people very close to me that are going through the same thing.  One son is the breadwinner and his other 3 brothers will literally take his debit card when he isn’t home and go take their wives to luxury restaurants (oh yeah and they don’t work).  Dude won’t leave his family for anything.  It’s clear as crystal that he’s being sucked dry and deserves better (yes, he has a very good salary compared to the rest of Pakistan but that’s not the point IMO, his siblings aren’t entitled to any of it and should get off their lazy asses and earn themselves, if someone else was keeping my wife and child fed I’d be so ashamed of myself, I can’t even offer sadaqah to friends here because their self respect is too high and they would rather go hungry than take charity, but then you get spoiled brats like this who would even try to sell your kidney so they wouldn’t have to give up the luxury lifestyle you provide them).  I love my siblings but they have fully functioning arms, legs and brains and can support themselves.   
 I’m not Pakistani and never grew up like this but I’ve been here long enough with my own in-laws and other families to see this dynamic at play.  Your American friends have good intentions but I’ve seen how toxic people can easily manipulate their own kids into sacrificing it all for them (most first world folks really don’t understand how this place works, even I’ll admit I would give my wife terrible advice on dealing with parasitic family or friends of the family).  I also know of another guy who’s wife got khula because of this.  He’d bring her sweets or fruits from the market and with his large family all in the same house, they’d get “offended” that he bought stuff for his wife but not them, so they ended up with all the mangos and Cadbury’s and she just got to watch them eat it.  It was 100% his fault because he didn’t grow a pair and tell them “I’m allowed to give my wife gifts you know right?”.  Tbh I don’t think I’d let my daughter marry here just because of how toxic the joint family system in bigger cities is (especially when they’re dogmatically religious and have all boys and insist on the wives to wear niqab 24/7 and never have privacy.  To me it feels hollow and like they’re twisting islam to suit their own desires). 
 I remit my own wife’s mother more than enough to cover all her basic needs and the rest she gets from a pension.  It’s nowhere near 2000$ (I don’t even remit that much for myself).  I spend maybe 300$ a month here tops on my own family, and that’s with me shopping every now and then at higher end places and eating out at higher end restaurants occasionally. If I tried hard enough I could probably knock about another 50-100 off.  This entitlement some people feel towards money being made either by OSPs or foreigners makes me sick.  You making a higher salary than even the average American doesn’t mean that you owe anyone that money.  And it’s also haram for people who aren’t needy to beg, so idk how religious his parents or brother are but you could play that card against them or if your husband is religious you could tell him he’s contributing to their sinful behavior by giving them the money knowing full well they have no right to ask for it.     I would support the parents but the siblings can go pound sand.

Reddit,"Husband and I disagree on the extent to which we should support his family financially, and it's tearing our marriage apart.",Ascenkay,When you say he's giving away money that you earned does that mean he's spending your money or his own? Because if it's the latter I don't see a problem. It's his money and he's free to spend as he likes given his own family is stable and doing well which you said that you are. So in this case if your husband is choosing to provide for his father and sibling than having nicer cars it's actually quite noble. Nobody ever got poor giving to other people. Allah is the ultimate provider. You will get more iA but this mentality that you must become selfish to grow is unreasonable.

 Remember he has a loan of 200k plus interest already. That should be his top priority to pay it off. If couple has another kid they will be financially ruined.  
 Remember no one from his family but themselves can save them. 
 And it is a parents duty to raise a child and make him able without the expectation that 'the child has to pay them back.' That is not Islam.  
 Any self respecting parent would not bank on the fact on this expectation this sort of regular payment from their child. 
 The husband is being actively told that it is his duty to support his entire family of father, brother and sister.  
 Generational wealth is only developed going forward. Not backward. 
 Couple needs professional financial counseling someone to terrify the husband with actually financial projections and scenarios. Or just a good financially stable friend who can talk to some sense into the husband.

Tell him you will leave him if he doesn't put his immediate family first. Do not budge on a financial outcome that leaves you comfortable, because otherwise the limit will always be set on when you say no. Your mental and emotional labor is worth much more than he's willing to put a number on. These parasites will bleed you dry and and ask you to thank them for it. Trust me when I say I've seen it happen over and over with the same result, feeling spent and stressed and behind all the time, because it never stops. 
 i'm 100% serious when i say leave him if he doesn't get with the program. Do not compromise with their family over their narcissistic behavior and refuse to talk to them unless they show a complete and thorough acknowledgement of their part in it. 
 Your mental health and your child's future is not worth this. 
 Beware 'nice guys' who dump all the work of making mature decisions on you because they simply haven't grown up and don't like the cost of learning how to deal with everything you've just described. They will ruin your life and then wake up with resentments that they will blame you for. If he doesn't follow through with what he says, do not trust him. This is as much a problem that he's allowed to fester as it is his own family's doing. Expect all hell to break loose the moment you set a real boundary, and I implore you to give it no energy whatsoever. Any tiny bit of information or argument will be used and twisted against you, don't try to justify it, just do it. Gray rock otherwise, because they will try everything but admit they're wrong to use your husband as their cash cow. 
 Once everything from basic lifestyle needs, to housing, debts and a college fund for your kid is sorted, you can consider doing something charitable, but you're in no position to do it now without actively losing out the best possible future for your kid and yourself.

 There it is. This is not a partnership mentality. She would earn more on her own if she didn't have a kid with him, and that commitment shouldn't be a punishment nor was it ever meant to be. The very basis of her being with him is based on shared values and burdens, which if he's only willing to honor ones that are important to him isn't a full commitment. Get over yourself, it's not how a marriage works. 
 
 They are also his family. You don't cut ties with your blood when you get married. 
 
 Of course, but if the family you marry into is toxic, and is willing to bleed you dry and harm your mental well being, take opportunities away from your child, and constantly harrass your day to day mental health with no remorse, you are the priority in the marriage, not his old family.

Being married and having a typical Desi susral where the father thinks he's retired even from his spoiled single son who's probably dating around and showing off your money!  
 The trick you need to handle this matter very delicately otherwise it can ruin your marraige or mark a spot in your husband's mind around you! I can sense your husband is an extremely good human being with a very decent income and bright future and you both need each other more then anyone else do!  
 As for his father let him do whatever he wants because sons who do so much for fathers wants appreciation from spouse and not welcome the negativity however for your brother I am sure you must be complaining to your husband already but you need to slowly brainwash your husband into the fact that you are responsible for the necessities not the luxuries and we need to save ourselves a lot of money as you have to pay off your fees and if we want out kid to have a bright future, own a fancy house and build something to ourselves we need to cut down a bit and stay low-key, also try to tell him that don't show off his money as well , explain it to his brother and father that he is in debt of student loan of $200,000 which is quite a lot and we need to get rid of it and your husband is very stressed about it and keep repeating such statements because in susraal you need to be a little dheet as for his brother I think your husband needs to make him sit in front and ask him what's his deal and what he's upto and he needs to be more responsible now and can't let him do whatever he wants if he wants a pizza okay but everything should be in limit no need to waste his or yours hard earn money!

Reddit,"Husband and I disagree on the extent to which we should support his family financially, and it's tearing our marriage apart.",IntroductionDry2004,"Hey OP, my comment is really late but I hope you read this, to get my perspective and I get yours and maybe we can both understand these dynamics and forces at work that we seem not to understand.  
 So, my elder brother is 8 years older to me, same position your husband and his younger brother are in. So I was probably the younger brother.  
 I was in 5th grade when my elder brother left for Canada for his studies. We lived in Islamabad’s poshest sector, most expensive, we were surrounded by Pakistanis who worked for the UN or just foreigners. Back then going abroad for studies wasn’t really a thing thing, it was too expensive and it was just a lil number of Pakistanis who could actually afford going for studies and my parents clearly weren’t. But my brother had to get out of the toxic house that we did have and just wanted funding to leave and first year of funding and like other youngsters was under the impression that he’d work there and study at the same time and pay his own tuition fee. That never happened.  
 While he left, the first year went by, but came next years tuition fee and he started asking my dad for the tuition fee. And that’s when things messed up. Moms gold sold, we started surviving On a single meal, I dropped out of the school we were studying at previously, hell we left Islamabad coz we rented that out and moved to our home towns old house. I had a complete shift in my life style and life in general. It wasn’t easy. The scars I got back then still exist. I’ve been scarred for life. The trauma I went through. To top it all off, our dad has always been a narcissist and I was his black sheep. My brother and sister were his favourites.  
 6 years later my brother graduated, started working. Didn’t send any money though. No help. All of this really had a toll on my mental health back then. Little traumas every day. I sucked at school. Couldn’t study at all. And i went into sports to get my aggression out. Constant tension. Constantly things being sold. My dads Rolex being sold. My dad was running a successful factory back then. That shut down. My dad simply couldn’t handle any of it. And I was the foot soldier caught between the crossfire. To top it all off, when I was in my Alvls, my brother started saying I was too spoilt. That stuck to me and got to me. My sister being as toxic started saying the same. Now both of them working but not really contributing to anything at home started saying I was spoilt and I’m not doing anything in life. Whereas I was just studying high school.  
 I had to take gap years because of all of this drama and my brother came to Pakistan for his first 2 week visit 7 years later now that he had money. Mind you, no one ever mentioned to him of our life style changes much. He was the fav and not to be bothered. And then he started with his boasting obviously of how successful he was. But I became the target like always. The black sheep. Took gap years, started uni, got my law degree with little financial help from him as well, back then probably 3000$ in total. During the whole period I was constantly being punched by every one for not doing anything.  
 Your brother in law was probably me, with the exception, nothing really spent on me other than the bare basics. My dad getting me clothes was an actual problem. Now that I look back, and have a kid of my own, I realise how all of that was just toxic. I’ve got serious mental health issues now. My brothers contribution? A 5 year old MacBook handed over to me, 3 year old iPhone passed on to me, old clothes or shoes passed to me all out of his free will because he forcefully did it to get passed his guilt. I never asked for it. After getting a Canadian passport and making some big buck, he moved to Pakistan for a few years on the pretext that he wanted to spend time with us, but it was just torture. He then left for Dubai and makes some big buck owning property in turkey, France and Dubai.  
 Damn, this was a rant but felt better. Look for the past, see why your brother is doing this and he needs to get over this. You said he mainly studied on student loans, did he then borrow anything from the dad? Even if he wants to help his dad out, it should be a reasonable amount and budgeted. Having a student loan on your back but paying 60-70 grand a year to your family won’t end well though. He need to know this. 
 Hence, looking for what you should do right now perhaps should be looked at the past. And you’ll get your answers. Eating chips and pizzas won’t be possible if you guys don’t get them home if it pinches you so much. I’m sure the brother in law just doesn’t appear at your place out of nowhere?",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/15zapvn/husband_and_i_disagree_on_the_extent_to_which_we/

 I can relate to that as well cause my chachu is similar here too and tbh OP situation is pretty much vigorously bad. I know how much a surgeon can earn easily in US and being desi with this lavish support anyone can be easily be spoiled. 
 As OP is an attorney and it’s even hard for her to set boundaries but the weak point here is OP hubby and he should be brought up to realise that how messed up his brother is when they treat him like  LADOO  and his sister gaslights the situation to have fun that’s how typical  phuphoo’s are tbh   
 Now there are some best methods to deal with this spoiled little brat situation and best option can be getting a appointment with a psychiatrist tell him this whole situation and get this as couple not for an individual and I do believe this might help you out and also there’re couple methods available online you can search on them and I’ve seen couple of movies dealing with this type of stuff. 
 
 I do believe this can be solved and how you’re not able to get that vacations and luxury treatment but making this as dispute between your relationship and making it worse, this is what they actually want to occur and even might try to get rid of yourself so best win against them is OP being the actual boundary between them

I along with my brother support my father back in Pakistan as well and we both send around $1200 combined. They also live in a 3 Br, 120 Sq.yd. home.  I don't think sending anything over $2k makes any sense. Furthermore, as an experiment, just by yourself,  plan a vacation e.g. 5-7 days in Hawaii and build some vacation fund e.g. 25k or a smaller 3 day trip to Cancun (funds reqd. around 5-10k) and take him with you on YOUR expense. I KNOW this seems harsh for now but I am suggesting that you do this ONCE to show what he's missing out on. Two working people are stressed out enough AS IS that any discussions about finances is just too much stress. So, if possible, take some time off and work towards getting there in next 3-six months (Cancun is great in Dec/Jan). Having taking this time off and reconnecting with each other will reinforce the value of a healthy marriage and companionship. Once you're back, hopefully, you can have a more production discussion.

Setting boundaries can be difficult, especially when there's a long-standing dynamic at play. 
 Sit down with your husband and have an open, honest conversation about your concerns. Make sure you both understand each other's perspectives and agree on a plan moving forward. Create a strict budget that outlines your financial goals, including paying off student loans and saving for your own needs and desires. Make sure to allocate a specific amount for family support. It's advisable to keep your salary separate. Your in-laws have a claim on your husband's income, not yours. Set aside a portion of your earnings for your own future goals. 
 If possible, have a conversation with your father in law about the financial strain their demands are causing. Be respectful but assertive in expressing your concerns. Sometimes, family members may not fully realize the impact of their actions. 
 Consistently reinforce your husband about the long-term financial goals. However, if your husband isn't receptive or communicative about this matter with your in-laws, your options might be limited. Changing family dynamics can take time. Be patient with your husband and yourself as you navigate these challenges.

 Are you in Isloo/Lahore? Karachi has phenomenal New York Style and Neapolitan style pies. If you're rich enough to afford it, that is. 
 The cheap joints are a hit or a miss. I know a lot of people crave that old skool Pizza Hut chicken tikka flavor from back in the day. Papi's Pizza is the only modern pizza place I've found that replicates that well. Don't get me started on those local joints that use some mystery white sauce as their base instead of marinara. 
 As far as other Pakistani foods go, I'd say most daal (the pureed liquid kind you're supposed to have with chawal) is bland as hell. I've had some very good daals in my life, but they usually contain some extra element such a loki or imli that gives them some khatta factor.

 In Canada (atleast in Toronto area and Montreal), most Pakistani restaurants clearly state ""Pakistani"" cuisine or ""Pakistani-Indian"" ""Indo-Pak"" cuisine).  
 I have also seen ""Pak-Afghan"" cuisine for Pashtun food.  
 It also might have to do with appealing to a wider market. Originally in the US people associated all East Asian cultures as Chinese, so to access a larger market even Thai, Viet, Malay cuisine restaurant would label themselves as ""Chinese cuisines."" Similarly, many people club Pakistanis/Sri Lankans/Bangladeshis under the ""Indian"" umbrella.  
 Also, ""Indian cuisine"" in the West is essentially North-Indian/Punjabi cuisine which is similar to the cuisine consumed by most Pakistanis (i.e. desi ethnicities in Pak). Obviously Pakistani dishes are more meat oriented and have more beef/lamb but North Indian cuisine and those of eastern provinces of Pakistan is highly influenced by Mughal cuisine. In fact, the Lahore-Delhi corridor was historically considered one region by many empires.

 Core: Punjabi, Sindhi, Kashmiri,  Urdu-Hindi Speaker, maybe Gujjus as well 
 Semi-core: Marathi, Bengali, Oriyas, Konkani 
 Periphery: South Indians, Sri Lankans, Nepalis (are they even desi?) 
 Conversely from our western neighbours, I consider Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey to be similar in many ways....although the afghans are.....",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/5lilqy/pakistanis_restaurants_abroad_using_the_term/

One thing we have to remember is that many customers are finding shops by searching online with YELP or CHOWHOUND.

 Also the label of Pakistani or Afgani is very much in flux in US.  Many people do not consider certain foods purely Pakistani or whatever such as Nihari.  Is it Indian or is it Pakistani?

 ​ 
 
 Busri  (Roti made in desi ghee which has makhan + molten sugar syrup inside) 
 Churi  Basically a scrambled busri (Long time ago, this was used to be served in village wedding feasts, atleast in ours) 
 Taryal Patata(fried potatoes) (part of staple diet) -- with rice = Bhat Patata. Most common combo is Bhat Patata and Daal. 
 Dudh (basically Namkeen lassi) 
 Thadal  (It's not commonly made at home, but you can find vendors in all over sindh), if you ever stop by in Hala make sure to try one) legend has it sindh's pehlwan (wrestler's) used to drink it for energy, it's NOT that common that people put any weed into em, like most would have you believe. But yea there are variations with weed in em. Extremely refreshing. 
 Khanni (Extremely rare, It's an alternate of haleem which doesn't use any meat and only use lentils, I don't have recipe but if someone wants I can try asking my mother) 
 Saai Bhaaji (palak or saag) , there is another variation which is called mix bhaji which basically uses multiple vegs carrot, palak, etc commonly eaten with achaar. 
 Pallo (fish) 
 Panjeeri ke laddoo  never been a fan. 
 Kari Pakora  Kari pakora's are the best. 
 Beh  (very common, mostly part of mixed vegitables) 
 Chanwar + anb (rice + mango)  - It's still is a summer treat.

This results in rapidly progressive dementia, seizures and sadly death. Cannibals in New Guinea got ""Kuru"". When they would eat contaminated brains of other humans, it raised their chances of getting prions. Most of their population was wiped out because of it.

For example, lets look at Canada. The official policy adopted by the colonizers was to destroy the language and culture of the indigenous people, no secret. State formed residential schools where native kids were boarded - taken forcibly from their parents, abused in every sense of the word. Lately, mass graves of those kids are being discovered across Canada. The official policy was to kill the Indian, save the man who should follow their language and culture and hate their own. 
The colonized nations are still not free. They are made to believe that their colonizers were superior than their own race. Decolonization of minds requires a movement of its own around the world.

The primary motivation for many workers in this sector is the tips they receive, which can sometimes be the only additional income they earn. 
 While I completely agree that directly asking for tips is inappropriate, I never encouraged my team to do so during my time in the industry. Instead, I set a target for tips, which were then distributed between the kitchen and front-of-house teams at a ratio determined by management, typically 70-30 or 80-20. This system encouraged the staff to provide exceptional service to earn better tips. 
 In situations where tip solicitation is an issue, I recommend not airing grievances on social media groups, specially Facebook as naming specific employees or designation can lead to serious consequences, including job termination. A more constructive approach would be to communicate directly with the manager, expressing concerns that tipping should be optional and left to the customer's discretion.

Reddit,What is with this American begging for tip culture in Pakistan?,Yushaalmuhajir,"This isn’t really it.  I’m American and we tip based on how much the bill is.  It’s basically pounded into our heads as kids that not tipping is essentially theft.  Base amount should be 10%, and if service is exceptional then 20% or more if you want.  I stick with 10% here because trying to give more in the past has gotten me harassed later for money.  And if I can afford to eat at a decent restaurant I can afford to tip.   
 Even in church (prior to me being a Muslim) the pastor scolded the congregation because the worst tippers are old church boomers who didn’t have to live off of tips like American servers do and they don’t tip and are rude.  His daughter was a waitress and me myself who worked fast food when I was younger absolutely hated the Sunday crowd.  He basically said if you can’t afford to tip go eat fast food.  The whole culture in the US with tipping is screwed and IMO is just an excuse for employers to not pay, because servers in the US don’t make automatic minimum wage.  Meanwhile in Europe everyone makes minimum wage and the one time I tried tipping there the server came out and told me I forgot my money lol.  
 Hope this gives some insight on why Americans throw around tips way more than anyone else.  It’s not necessarily charity, it’s pounded into our heads that not tipping is wrong and the way the system in the US is set up, it kind of is.  I wish they would change the laws and force restaurants to actually pay waitstaff more than 2$ an hour.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1eh5ps9/what_is_with_this_american_begging_for_tip/

 No. That is hypocrisy because it's not about the money. Women say they want to be able to pursue their careers not because of money, but because of their own will, because they want to do it, regardless if it pays 10k or 100,000k. They say money doesn't matter, what matters is that they are given their rights. So have your rights and make as much as you want. Don't want to take care of the house? No worries, the husband doesn't have to either. Nobody should take care of the house because you can't force anyone 🤭

 However, you have a weird dynamic in your mind where you think that the wife would have to ""beg"" her husband for things if she doesnt have a carrier herself when you compared it with when you ask your father for stuff and he gets you that just out of love.  
 I've been raised by a homemaker and almost every elder woman I know in my family is a homemaker, not a career woman. Not even once I've witnessed that kind of dynamic. In fact, the men spend just a fraction of their income on themselves while the majority goes to their family. And wives usually ""demand"" not beg and husbands usually go above and beyond to fulfill those demands and to make their wives happy, while in return, the wives take care or their husbands and children. Isnt that how a normal family supposed to be in a homemaker dynamic lol? How is it ""free labour""? Trust me hiring paid labour to do your housework and look after you is waayyy cheaper than having a wife and maintaining her lifestyle. 
 Also, I don't think that people are asking you to leave your career because they are ""controlling"". It's often because of the provider and protective mindset of men that why should their wives go out and face the harsh world as well when they are doing it already. You may call it pride or whatever but this is the usual mindset.  
 People want different things and you cant blame them for having a preference. They have a right to chose a wife who would be a homemaker and you have a right to choose a husband who doesn't have a problem with you working.

(148th on GGI for a reason)",BongCloudLife,"Listen lady... (behen?)... get out of your bubble and stop confusing your social issues with the deep rooted structural inequalities in Pakistan that actually cause the gender gaps, including gender earnigs gap etc.  
 You are an educated, high-earning, remote working baddie... awesome and more power to you. What you are facing are gender norms and social pressures, which, in some ways, are experienced by all people (all genders) to their detriment, and the power to defeat them is entirely with you, and your ability to say no. The lady-medical student who couldnt become a practicing doctor because Baba Jan and Hubby didnt allow it, are to blame themselves. These women need to take responsibility and claim their freedom. Independence isnt comfortable and one has to make hard choices.  
 So what causes gender gaps in Pakistan. Lets see...  
 In the developed world, there is a brewing boy crisis where boys are falling behind women in education. Pakistan (and similiar countries) are so far behind, that still in Pakistan, women are unable to get an education. That means opportunities for women, are limited. This does not apply to you.  
 Then, mobility is a problem. Women start experiencing sexual harrasment when they step out of their homes, on the way to work in public as well as pvt transport, at work.. on the way back... and sadly... even at home. You know better than me of this struggle.  We have failed to mobilize women so they can't participate in the economy. Unsafe public transport... unsafe work environments, lack of professionalism, access to healthcare etc means vulnerable classes, including women, are not able to participate in the economy and move up the social ladder.  
 Then there are lack of opportunities. What can an uneducated woman from lower class do in Pakistan, ... Nanny, Cook, maid... ? Why cant they be drivers, traffic police, cashiers at stores... road side vendors, petrol pump staff (exceptions do exist). Our society is not geared to let women function at grass root levels.  
 Taken together, this results in a lack of opportunity for women to grow into entrepreneurs, leaders, politicians etc thereby causing all sort of gender gaps. If we improve women economic participation, Pakistan can flourish... 
 So.. in summary... gender gaps are being caused by significant structural issues... you are part of a small minority of women who have the means to be independent. Dont let hubby... or even mama, baba, nani amma or dada abbu tell you to give that up because ""tum apnay ghar ki hojao gi tu aram aajayega"" or ""grandkids chahyein"".

A choice will always exist for a man in Pakistan to have a housewife. A choice will always exist for a man that he can have a working woman as a wife.    
 On the other hand, a woman will always have the choice to have a husband that doesn't care if she's 100% focused on her career. A woman will always have a choice to have a husband that bears all the financial burden.  
 In your case, you are being met with proposals that are trying to mend you into something that you are not. Any half-intelligent proposal would respect your career-boundary, and part ways from you, in case they want a housewife. Parting ways quickly, can prevent online rants from both sides. 
 It's a completely different discussion on how families function if the mother is a career-focused professional; however, you might be able to get some comments from working women in the comment section. 
 The institution of family is for the sole purpose of comfort for the spouses, and a beautiful protective shield for the children. It's not domestic labor. It's not a grind. It's not a job. It's not a burden. And at the same time, it is. It's something that Allah has framed us into, and we can't escape it once we're in it.  
 I personally don't like the fact that the ""good cop"" among the parents: the woman, has to work a 9-5 in order to meet expenditures, or provide for the children. And this is becoming a huge problem for women even in the west. Very few jobs are ""passions"". Most are just worthless grinds that drain the life force out of men, and let alone what women go through.   
 The capitalistic system thrives on a weakened institution of family. Consumerism peaks when a family fails to be born. A man should chase lust and power. The woman should chase fame and glamor. No place for family here. 
 In this society, careers emerge out of compulsion, and are shaped due to family, geography, health, mental health, and much more. If you believe that yours is a ""passion"", then understand that the ""bridge"" that you talked about in the last paragraph of your essay, is whatever you make of it. Use it to go.... where you want, or not at all... 
 Leverage your ""passion"" or ""career"" to get something better for yourself. But maybe try to reevaluate if the definition of family will work for you or not... Because the definition of ""family"" itself is the antithesis of personal pursuits.  
 Learning about Allah's philosophy regarding humanity will help reframe our duties, obligations, and the extent of personal pursuits... It might help you take not only better decisions, but make them with a lot of peace and confidence. In the end, it's just the contentment in our choices. Paint your decisions with divine subservience to find that peace, is my advice.

But this depends on a lot of factors. Plough dominated agriculture was mostly men because of how physically demanding it was (some even say that patriarchy is stronger in those areas). Women would have different work to do (and also housework was genuinely time consuming: making clothing, converting raw ingredients into food, washing clothes manually etc.) and you also needed to produce many children because of child mortality and the usefulness of extra labour. There were undoubtedly adjustments made to accommodate that.  
 But what does that have to do with anything? This is an English speaking subreddit on a post about a high earning professional (basically aristocratic in terms of relative wealth, and aristocratic women didn't work). We don't live in that brutal Malthusian world anymore. Not even the illiterate peasants of Pakistan live in that world. And peasant women were completely dependent on their families.

Reddit,I owe an apology to all the women living in Pakistan,Eepybeany,"Its not about being shallow. I’m not talking about men who have prior sexual experiences. Im talking about men who are virgins themselves. How is mutually being your partner’s one and only being shallow? The virginity as the appeal is not what I’m talking about at all and you grossly misconstrued my words.  
 Just to be clear, if an ‘experienced’ man has this experience, then he’s shallow and hypocritical. I think I made that clear already but apparently you missed it in your graphic detailing of intercourse.  
 And by saying that virgin men are allowed to have the preference of a virgin wife doesn’t mean that all women who aren’t virgins are unclean. I’m absolutely against that mindset. Women can do whatever they want but men, who do control themselves, can care about their partner’s past. Most men in Pakistan are Muslims and being one means that most do not act on their desires. Most women don’t either, mind you. 
 That being said, there is a large portion of virgin men in Pakistan, who think that a virgin wife is their God given right. What I mean by that is they think that if a woman does engage in premarital sex, she has to disclose it to them before marriage even though Islam allows the women to hide their sins and as long as the woman intends to be faithful after marriage she’s well within her rights to hide her past at the time of marriage. Most Pakistani and Muslim men in general denounce this is as if its an unforgivable sin even though a woman having premarital sex is a sin to God, not you.  
 Unfortunately if the woman does disclose her past, most men, perhaps even myself, will not marry her. Maybe she’s reformed (for lack of a better word), but the guy is allowed to have a preference. This preference is as shallow as wanting a beautiful face or tall stature or even money. You’re allowed to have them.

 Yeah I know.. 
 >How is mutually being your partner’s one and only being shallow? 
 the idea of ""one and only"" is shallow. How narcissist are these Pakistani ""men""? What happened to falling in love Bollywood style, and as soon as you find out that your love is not a ""virgin"" what happens to the love? I don't think it is written on the girl's forehead that she is a virgin or not.  
 >Just to be clear, if an ‘experienced’ man has this experience, then he’s shallow and hypocritical. 
 Yeah, no.. both types are shallow. You can't just make up rules as you go along. And why we teach this, and why the hell is this a thing in our shallow society? I don't think its Pakistani ""men"" alone, its south Asian community as a whole, so religion doesn't matter, Youtube is full of people like you who are defending these ideas, especially based on the religious values. 
 >I’m absolutely against that mindset. 
 yeah, sure. your essay comment says otherwise. 
 >Most men in Pakistan are Muslims and being one means that most do not act on their desires. Most women don’t either, mind you. 
 Now this is quite funny. ""Muslim"". Its not just ""Muslims"" its generally south Asian countries, and in that community there are multiple religions, so this idea is not exclusively to the ""Muslims"". And stop thinking you are superiors, just because you are a ""Muslim"", culturally we never changed our old ways, its just now we are in a separate country now, pretending that we are better.  
 >That being said, there is a large portion of virgin men in Pakistan, who think that a virgin wife is their God given right.  
 And who is supposed to change this shitty ideology? Its been almost 80 years we have been separated from our neighbor. What is exactly the difference?  
 > she has to disclose it to them before marriage 
 its called communication.  
 >even though Islam allows the women to hide their sins 
 why does she needs to hide? Did she do a crime against humanity or something?  
 >Most Pakistani and Muslim men 
 yes mostly people like you. is this what ""Muslims"" learn in their religion? Didn't your prophet married almost exclusively divorced women? What do you think, did her wives disclosed her past? And imagine, a person in 6th century is more progressive than 99.99% Pakistani / Muslim men in 2025. I have no clue what kind of ""Muslim"" religion you guys are following. And I never understood how easily you guys blame your religion for everything, even tho it doesn't really teach you about marrying a virgin.  
 >most men, perhaps even myself,

 >Maybe she’s reformed (for lack of a better word) 
 HOLY FKKK! Your language suggest she did crime against humanity which is punishable by your bigotry.  
 >This preference is as shallow as wanting a beautiful face or tall stature or even money.

Reddit,I owe an apology to all the women living in Pakistan,Eepybeany,"If you’re Muslim you aren’t supposed to have premarital sex. I don’t see people who do have premarital sex as inferior, but i do think that someone who indulges in these acts does not hold the same values as me. Or at least they once didn’t so I can’t be sure about them now. If you’re not Muslim, I can’t make you understand.  
 And its not just men who want a one and only. Muslim women also feel the same way. How is this shallow you failed to explain. Why is it narcissistic to be each other’s only? If you want to have sex and fulfill your desires then go ahead. 
 A man having premarital sex but condemning it in women means that he doesn’t hold any such values and instead holds a preference due to the power dynamic you described that you seem to have forgotten. When two people are in the same situation, they are on level terms. Don’t you agree? So when one has an advantage of previous experience, there is a certain power dynamic. I called people who prefer this power dynamic, who prefer virgins to “take their virginity” purely out of that desire rather than any values (like abstaining from premarital sex) to be shallow. If you think this is making up rules and not a consistent narrative, I don’t know what to say to you. Can’t make a fish fly, now can you?  
 Im talking about it from a Muslim standpoint. Any cultural bias that is there, I’m unaware of it because guess what, being Muslim has meant that most men around me don’t have pre marital sex, or at least don’t tell other about it. From this point of view, and from living in a 99% Muslim country, I am sorry to say, this is going to be how interpret things. Maybe its a failing on my part, but this is all I have ever known. So of course I’m going to think religion is a factor, especially because my interactions with Arab men on the internet have brought me to the same conclusions. I don’t know if you have had the opportunity to engage with so many different religions on this topic, but I haven’t.  
 Why does a woman need to hide pre marital sex in a Muslim society? Because she’s in a Muslim society and any practicing woman and man stays away from this. Meaning its a sin. And you’re supposed to hide your sins. Marital sex is not a sin. So equating marrying a divorcee to a woman who has had extra marital relationships is disingenuous. I have no problem with marrying a divorcee if the stars align so to say. Its not the action for me but rather what it tells about the person that’s the problem for me.  
 Having said that, this is not the case for most Pakistani men. Like I said they want a virgin wife as if its their God given right. The Prophet married multiple divorcees and encouraged Muslim men to do the same during his time as well, because guess what, even then men wanted to marry virgins. This mindset is extremely toxic though and has to be changed. I cannot offer a method to so because I don’t know.  
 If you ask a practicing Muslim woman who hasn’t had pre marital sex in Pakistan, whether she would marry a virgin or one who’s not, guess who she will prefer if they’re equal in other areas? In Pakistan, its definitely a religion thing too.  
 I get the inkling you’re not a Muslim. If you bothered to read this essay answer which must be pretty difficult for you i guess judging from your level of reading comprehension, then maybe don’t talk about things you don’t know. From a Muslim point of view, leaving a life of sins defined by the religion is called reformation. And lmao. How is my not marrying a non-practicing Muslim woman bigotry?

Ik almost everywhere’s bad, but it’s very bad in Pakistan. Wives get thrown in kitchen (even if the husband loves her) and expected to cook like a robot for huge family dinners. Ik people who specifically got their sons married to mbbs degree holders, but after marriage were thrown in the kitchen as maids. Yes, there are women who love doing this, and I also want a woman who provides food to me when I provide sustenance to her, but I’m just saying, people marry their sons to degree holders and expect them to be the maid of the house. Then there’s this joint family system, house politics, in laws, the parents of the husband using the wife as their maid, like bro you’re not her parent, and there’s no Islamic obligation or anything for wives to work for the in laws. My sisters do hijab and abaya and all, and still men stare at them, but it’s less than women who don’t cover themselves up, and it’s their choice to wear whatever they want, as a man, my job is to not look at them. I don’t want gargoyles ogling my sisters, so I don’t do the same to other women.
And we don’t even know what happens were women in rural areas. My father once had a construction site near Muzaffergarh, and when he went to hire labour, only women were available, men stayed at home and women were forced to work in 45 degrees laying asphalt and shit. No one cares about their rights…
When it comes to marrying rights, women aren’t really given the authority to consent, they’re just asked “is he good looking?” And that’s enough… ik women who stay their whole lives in a house, in only girls school, they won’t have the experience to judge their life partner, but still…
Ik many cases in my own family where at some point of the wife’s life, she wanted a divorce and didn’t want to live with the person she was married to for several different reasons, but were pressured by her family to not do it or they will disown her, the reason? “He’s financially stable”
Like what?
When it comes to driving, women get ridiculed, get weird remarks and harsh looks. I’m happy that traffic wardens show leniency towards them…

 There is this fallacy that Pakistan has some unique beauty. Entire world is beautiful.  But in order to attract tourist you need: 
 - Marketing Infrastructure: World wide marketing campaigns to attract tourist. 
 - Visa Policy: An easy an convenient way for foreigners to apply for visas and receive them. 
 - Transportation Infrastructure: Airports, Railways, Buses etc to move people in and out of the country. 
 - Actual Tourism related Infrastructure. Hotels, tourist attractions, tourism related service industry etc

Reddit,Can We Really Handle Tourism?,TerryMakichoott,"I'm a foreigner living here and tbh I think mass tourism would have a negative effect on society.  Nepal is pretty culturally similar to Pakistan as well as India and they're massive tourist hubs, but the difference between Pakistan and those two countries is the scam culture is far far less in Pakistan, tourists here generally aren't degenerates looking for ""a good time"" involving drugs or sex tourism.  Pakistanis are still hospitable and generally treat even non-muslim foreigners pretty good (I have no complaints about hospitality despite being here for close to 5 years, though I'm a convert to Islam).   
 In Nepal and India I get people walking up to me asking me to buy drugs, go to a ""spa"" (only common in the touristy parts of Kathmandu, in India it's pretty much everywhere).  Rickshaw drivers harass you into getting rides at inflated rates.  Drunk foreigners and drunk locals fighting at and outside the bars stumbling around like morons (you'd have to build bars and nightclubs here for mass tourism, unfortunately the reality is most of the Europeans traveling to Asia see it as a giant brothel and frat party, it's bad in Bangkok, really really bad). 
 It's already fairly easy for foreigners wanting to see beautiful and historical sites.  I just have a guy up north I use (made sure to verify he was in the tourism business and he has no issues showing me his card or CNIC).   
 But yeah the airports here are a hot mess.  The worst I've ever been to.  There's no order at all, it's pure chaos.  Though on the bright side I can get through pretty fast, only annoying thing is the porters grabbing my stuff when I tell them no and cab drivers trying to do the same thing and then charging 10 times the fare an inDrive would charge.  I'd rather walk than take a cab driven by those haramkhors.",6 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1n84ld2/can_we_really_handle_tourism/

Jab unko apna nahi samjho gay tu how do you expect them to show that apniyat. I am not saying go out all partying and drinking/dancing all night but pick up activities that you are fine doing in your own circles right?. That "" apniyat "" will come when you make an effort. Example, when we go out, my friends (mostly east asians and latinos) know i need some halal/veg options, I have may be told them once when we first went out.  Now, whenever we go out they make sure whichever restaurant they pick it has to have some options for me without me ever asking (that's  apniyat  to me). They can easily hangout without me but they make an effort.     
 As for culture, I have hosted them for iftar dinners and on eid weekend and they have invited me during christmas season for gift exchange. I randomly send them pakistani mangoes and food i make and I can assure you those plates have never returned empty. We find days to get together for board game nights and go out for movies. it happens over time and yes you will have to make an effort for it happen.

 I am 45(m) and I am in Chicago USA (citizen by birth, lived 20 yrs in Karachi and 25 years in America) and I've been planning to return back to Karachi Pakistan very aggressively. I have family in both places. The biggest challenge, is of course a steady income, and then the kids/spouse refusal to move back ... so if you orchestrate and time it perfectly (i.e. earned/saved enough while the kids are under 9yr old) then you have a shot to move back to Pakistan ... remember URDU is a necessity for O/A level and Inter/Matric system, and as a Pakistani NICOP/Passport holder child, coming from the west, they need at least 5 years before be able to pass the urdu exams in Pakistan for university admissions (else you'll be forced to send them to university on overseas quota seats which have gotten pretty expensive, about $20,000 per year).  
 Convincing your spouse to move back will be the greatest challenge of all times (I'm experiencing it first hand, everyday), however as another person mentioned, Islam is still available in Pakistan, your kids will have a better shot at life, they will speak urdu, they will have their roots and culture and identity developed, they can easily be doctors or engineers by age 22, they can easily get married insh'allah, away from drugs, alcohol zinaa, haraam food, poor financial decisions, being unnecessarily college dropouts. In addition, your marriage will stay protected there (I'm seeing a lot of divorces happening here in USA on a daily basis), arguments/fights over worldly stuff, commercial and materialistic society is destroying marriages and family values, eating us from inside, and pushing us to haraam, to ribaa and hefty interest and mortgage houses, credit card applications and car and student loans. 
 On YouTube, there is a clear video/fatwa by Dr. Zakir Naik, that living in non-muslim West (i.e. USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, Europe etc.) is absolutely Not Permitted.

Here in America I don’t make a whole lot of money and I am probably in lower middle class or poor income bracket but each morning I wake up, I don’t have to worry about not having hot water to shower because there’s no gas and geyser won’t work, in summers I don’t have to think twice about crazy high electricity bills if I turn on the AC because it’s so hot. I also don’t have to worry about back pain from commuting on broken roads or keep looking over my shoulder that a mobile snatcher might be coming my way.  
 Sure, I am a bit stressed sometimes about the visa and all but honestly this country is a place where you get rewarded proportionate to your level of efforts. No one is low balling you, the harder work you put in, the bigger the reward.  
 And as for, doing everything by yourself and not having servants or househelp for everything: well my dishwasher does the dishes, the washing and drying machines do the laundry, max I have to do is sweeping/mopping the floors and cleaning the surfaces and my bathroom.

 It took hard work and didn't involve odd jobs. Point being if you're willing to put in the hard work - you'll get the results. Unfortunately, a lot of Pakistanis that move here come with a mindset of 'reaching here' is the finish line. And now that they're here, they're guaranteed success.  
 When the reality hits and no maids come to do the dishes, cook food and they don't directly land the positions they were imagining. They simply settle for an uber gig or a convenience store job and never push forward.. That's were the 'yahan mushkil life hai, Pakistan main mazay thay' narratives come from.  
 Ultimately, you'll get success if you are willing to put in the hard work. This is something that cannot be said about living in Pakistan.

Reddit,Why America?,turumti,"I won’t argue the political climate is bad in the US or how the federal government is behaving under Trump.  
 But I will say that average Americans once you get to know them are generally great people and are friendly and helpful. Generally you have a lot of freedom and are able to live your life as you wish. This comes with the expectation that you are also okay with other people living their lives freely and as they wish, which to me is a very good thing.  
 If you’re middle/upper middle class and come to the US, you can expect a bit of a culture shock because there are no maids, cooks, cleaners and you will do everything yourself. If you make enough money you can hire someone to come in a couple times a week but it’s not cheap.  
 You can work hard here and be more successful than in many other countries. There is a ton of opportunity even through things are not handed to you on a plate.  
 There is a certain amount of peace in working hard and being left alone to do your own thing which is what I like about life here. I have no doubt that for a working class person, America offers a quality of life that is simply unattainable in Pakistan - you just don’t have access to the same economic mobility in Pakistan.  
 I do miss friends and family, but in Karachi I used to feel overwhelmed with constant social interactions and obligations which are far more manageable here.  
 I also have the opportunity to pursue hobbies here which are hard to pursue in Pakistan from a cost and time perspective.  
 In Karachi, all my spare time used to be spent chasing down a lineman for shitty internet service, a water tanker for water, servant drama, traffic jams because “route lag gayee”, repeated attempts to get the same things fixed over and over (cars, appliances, whatever).  
 Here I have that time to read, pray, build (carpentry, drones as a hobby), ride mountain bikes, hike, camp, etc. I am also able to pay for my parents needs (healthcare etc) in Pakistan while earning in the US because the currency conversion works out very favorably.  
 When you get old, Pakistan again pulls ahead - people around so you won’t be lonely, affordable health care, can afford medical attendants, drivers, cook whatever 24/7 etc.  
 So ultimately you have to analyze where you are in life and see what tradeoffs you’re happiest with. I’m very glad I had the opportunity to have access to both Pakistan and the United States. I love both.

Reddit,Overseas Pakistanis- how do you deal with in laws visiting (staying) for extended period of time?,daalchawwal,"My husband's parents come to visit us every year (mine don't, but the reasons are not culturally related). I am extremely uncomfortable if my privacy, home comfort, or schedule are disrupted. This is natural. My parents in law come for 1 month usually, which I think is a good period of time for both parties. 
 When we were living in a small apartment, my husband requested for us to shift to an inflatable bed and donate our room to his parents for a month. I was okay with this as I would have wanted the same for my parents. Many other changes happened, including huge electricity bills (they came during winter and couldn't live without the heater), outing, groceries, etc. Weekends were dedicated to them exploring. I had to cook every day. They took over the lounge and TV completely etc. 
 Despite it all, my husband made sure that I could have some sense of space to myself, no matter how limited. This made those 4 weeks tolerable. He: 
 - gave me breaks from going out, and took his parents out himself 
 - got up early to tend to their breakfast needs so I could just focus on dinner instead 
 - made sure I was not disturbed while WFH 
 - took over all the bills I usually took care of for the time period 
 - did not force me to sit with his parents 24/7; I was able to take a breather in our smaller room. 
 - showed shopping routes to his parents and encouraged them to go out by themselves. 
 - suggested that we alternate visits: that they visit us one year and we visit them the next (his parents agreed) 
 - he encouraged them to stay with other siblings in other cities through positive reinforcement (they were initially wanting to stay with us the longest period of time). 
 It also helped that he had already briefed them about our work schedules before they came, so there was no mismatch in social expectations. He also ran everything past me, made sure we were on the same page with all plans, and acknowledged or apologised every time in-laws did not display the best behaviour towards me. 
 3 months is definitely a long time and getting one's life disrupted this way is not easy. Also, your wife should be running all plans past you. You're both a unit and should approach all guests as a unit, rather than family bias. 
 Speak to her about the disruptions and exhaustions. If there's possibilities of them visiting other people in the country/city, explore those. Next time send your wife to them instead/visit together. Communication is key!

Reddit,Overseas Pakistanis- how do you deal with in laws visiting (staying) for extended period of time?,spring_park,"Sorry to hear this, OP. I am not Pakistani but my husband is and went through the same thing with in-laws, my husband’s brother and his wife who is also their first cousin. 
 Setting aside the cultural differences, I was overly uncomfortable having non-existent privacy in our old apartment. They came one day and my husband didn’t even discuss with me prior that they will stay with us indefinitely. What I heard was “family should stay together”. As how they were in Pakistan. 
 The wife would overhear everything and “report” to family back in Pakistan and they would make unsolicited comments with how we raise our child (She herself is not a mother yet). Then I was told that it was my husband who was asked to marry her and my husband refused so she ended up with my brother-in-law instead. This was very disturbing for me and would think the unimaginable when I am not home or at work. 
 I finally had the courage to tell my brother-in-law to find themselves their own accommodation but he took it negatively. It was affecting my mental health. His wife was the laziest person I have met and don’t clean common areas. 
 What I learned was that in these situations, we need to be firm in setting boundaries. If you felt discomfort the first time, communicate it immediately with your other half. Having someone in your safe space, regardless if family, should be discussed. Both parties should be on the same page - no surprises that’s very disrespectful. Your wife’s top priority should be you and your children. It’s not like you’re stopping her from having her side of the family over but she should not also compromise her relationship with you. And if you let things go the first time, there is a chance you will get gaslighted if they’re getting this reaction only later. Which happened with me when I tolerated and kept mum for 2 years just to avoid dramas. 
 Also, I’d like to add that me and my husband agreed to only have family over when we both can take annual leave from work. So say maximum 2 weeks. That way, both parties are relaxed and overseas family can have the holiday they’re expecting. Because let’s face it, they get bored staying at home in a foreign country.

Reddit,Overseas Pakistanis- how do you deal with in laws visiting (staying) for extended period of time?,Immediate_Tip_1445,"Here’s how I’d frame it: 
 
 Start with partnership
You’re in a marriage now, which means big decisions like parents staying for months need to be discussed and agreed on by both of you. It’s not just her call or your call; it affects your shared life and home. 
 Acknowledge her needs, then share yours
Let her know you respect that she wants time with her parents and that you’re glad she’s close to them. But also be honest about how last time drained you three months of constant responsibility, no privacy, and no real downtime in your own home. This isn’t about rejecting her parents, it’s about your capacity. 
 Frame it around your relationship
Make it clear the issue isn’t her parents but the health of your marriage. You want your home to remain a place where you both can relax and feel comfortable. Reassure her that you value her parents, but the arrangement has to work for both of you. 
 Set a new standard
Suggest a shorter visit that feels manageable to you (for example, one month). And agree together that in the future, any extended visits will be discussed before commitments are made. That way neither of you feels blindsided, and your home stays a space you both can enjoy. 
 
 TL;DR: Start with partnership, acknowledge her needs, explain your limits, and agree on a shorter visit together.",0 points,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1nbgosh/overseas_pakistanis_how_do_you_deal_with_in_laws/

 Suggest having a talk with your wife, nicely, about putting a cap on the total stay? Is there any family where you are, so you can get them tickets to go visit for a couple of weeks midway through the trip to break it up into two stretches? 
 And agree with your wife that she can visit them for 6 weeks a year, and they can visit for 6 weeks too.

 HBL is considered better than many. Although, I dont like banks here at all. If you are in Lahore, pack up for a bike ride in Androon Lahore/ Walled city, as you will find true colours of Lahore there. 
 For food, you can look upto any place your friend suggests, or best you can do is look upto youtube channels for a better guide for food choices here, although you would love food here only if you go to the right places. 
 And do wear casual but warm clothes, not too much not too less. Also you can visit some historical places like Lahore Museum, Lahore fort, anarkali bazaar, androon Lahore, and a lot of places, it would take days but will be worth the ride.

 Also, there isn’t really such a thing as one Indian cuisine, let alone a combined Pakistani and Indian cuisine. The traditional food you’ll find in Kerala, Kashmir, Karachi, Kolkata, Peshawar and Swat is already so different from each other, you can’t really clump it together. 
 My assumption is that what you think of as desi food are dishes with similar base spices like ginger and garlic. If you start a dish with those, whatever flavours you build on top still remain in the same broad flavour category, so you get used to it. Add to this certain spices that have become ubiquitous in major cities in Pakistan + North India, and you get a fairly uniform flavour profile.

Non spice based cuisine. Italian, Japanese, French, I feel this is closest challenge to desi since it’s just ingredient but very well cooked. I do like European food it’s gorgeous. And French pattiseriee are incredible. Italian is closest imo to Pakistani food culture they adore food but recently I’ve gone off pasta and then 99% Italian food is a non option.. but espresso, pizza, yum
Meaty cuisines, Arabs, again give me desi food ANY time of the day, schwarma, fatiyer are all ok though.

 To lose weight you just need to cut calories down , and exercise if you can’t to omad , try keto

Reddit,Some food my family has made the past few months,deleted,"We Nepalese people eat low oil, low masala and aromatic food. And our lifestyle is comparatively active. But yeah, lot of people in our country don't know about nutrition. I eat protien, fruits, nuts which are packed in nutrition. And boiled, low oil sabji, rice and all. Desserts are my weakness that is it. And yes I workout 5 times a week, drink 3-4 ltrs of water per day. That is it. I am healthy. I don't need to put a lot of efforts. I can follow these simple steps and still loose weight.

 if you want more of a ""pakistani touch"" you can try skipping the onions. the most popular biryani here comes from the city of karachi (your roomie might be from there too!) and it has zero to no onions, loads of tomatoes as well as potatoes (super polarizing topic here lol) and the meat in it is pre-cooked (although you add it after making the gravy rather than adding it first) 
 other cities have varying versions, but this one beats all of them by far. lmk if you want to know anything else :'))

Reddit,Biryani help,AmiraMusafirah,"Listen, I'm going to share with you a personal and embarrassing story.  
 I, too, was on the search for the ideal biryani flavor, and wanted to make it from scratch. I tried several different recipes from online and while they were good/ok, none of them gave that perfect biryani flavor. 😓 
 There's a local Auntie who's famous for her biryani, I asked her for her recipe. As soon as she mentioned she used Shan Bombay Biryani packet masala, I accepted defeat. I'm a bit of a from-scratch snob, and kind of look down on the packet mixes. 🫣 We never used them in my house growing up. 
 But I take the L here. Get the packet.  
 Once I started using it, biryani is the easiest thing in the world to make and get right. It's hard for me to order biryani from outside now because I prefer my homemade one more.  
 Make sure to get the Shan Bombay Biryani packet. I've tried other brands and versions (regular biryani Shan, National, Laziza) but this one is the best with the perfect blend of spices.

 Authentication shawarma is made with 'khubz' bread, which is not sold in pakistan. You can't expect wives or mothers to first bake an authentic khubz bread, then make the actual shawarma. Thats just not feasible.  
 As for the actual fillings, it depends on what children eats. No point in putting the time and effort in making the perfect shawarma aur uske baad bache kahye hi na tu fayeda? Many children don't like garlic and pickle fillings.  
 Maybe next time, attempt the authentic filling for yourself and your hubby.  
 Its the same analogy for chinese cuisine in pakistan, we pakistanis won't be able to take one bite of authentic chinese food, hence, we have altered the recipe to suit our taste buds.
