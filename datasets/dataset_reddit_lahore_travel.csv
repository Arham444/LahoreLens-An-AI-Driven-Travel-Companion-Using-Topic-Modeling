Reddit,Need suggestions for wedding gift. Early 200x Gen-Z couple btw.,Distinct-Ebb-9763,"That's a cool idea!! 
 But I believe every couple has their travel goals yk. So I am of the thinking that they might have some plans as well or somebody in the fame may have arranged it for them. So that doubts me. 
 Like in my family, the couple is so much into the prep and stuff and thus someone among us prepare the whole trip plan for them.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1pmg7g8/need_suggestions_for_wedding_gift_early_200x_genz/
Reddit,Want to visit old lahore .. coming from Multan .,Warm-Morning-8100,"first of all androon lahore might not be that fascinating in reallife as you might have seen on insta. Secondly you have two options, book a guided tour or visit places by yourself. 
 I would recommend following 
 - checkout the ""History by night"" event 
 - you will find good nastha places in androon (watch couple of youtube reviews), i can only recommend chand shahab's halwa puri 
 - visit badshahi and wazir khan mosque 
 - there is a foodstreet near badshahi mosque which you should definetly visit

Overland trips like this often have flexible roommate arrangements—many rotate roommates throughout the trip to keep things balanced. If you're a heavy sleeper and okay with sharing, you might not need the solo upgrade. However, having a private room can be a nice retreat after long days, especially at altitude.

 We were eventually given a standard coach as a replacement so we could continue the trip. Most people were happy about it as they thought the truck was unsafe - not just because it broke and couldn't be fixed, but it was like travelling in an old vehicle without any safety measures i.e. headrests, hipbelts etc. Plus the seats were uncomfortable, with same facing backwards, and there was much less space than on a coach.

Reddit,"after 30+ countries, here’s how i actually remember my trips (not what you’d expect)",rirez,"One of the things you learn in photography is to ""shoot in sets"" or ""scenes"". Don't just shoot one photo of a thing of interest. Shoot the subject, then get some close-up detail shots, then get some wide-angle shots. Then get some ""on the way"" shots and some ""on the way out"" shots. Then get some focused on humans, some focused on smells, some focused on sound, and some focused on texture. 
 It's a really useful photography exercise for all skill levels. You also learn to make a harmonious color palette of the location, and how to tell a story. 
 
 i started adding one sentence to my best photos at night. stuff like “got lost finding this” or “the hostel guy said this was overrated but i went anyway.” takes 5 min. genuinely changes everything. 
 
 I print my photos (Selphy printer) and write these down on their backs at the end of the day. Very fun. 
 Also, journaling and scrapbooking go a long way, and accomplish many of your goals, like re-narrating the trip to yourself.",245,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pss3ve/after_30_countries_heres_how_i_actually_remember/

 Six Asian countries in 10 days is a bit too rushed in my opinion. A lot of times hitting a lot of countries in a short amount of time, you get home and don't remember where you saw what. For instance on my last trip last month, I spent 3 days in Andorra, 2 days in Qatar, 6 days in Oman, 5 days in Kuwait, and 2 days in Barcelona. Since Andorra was so different than the middle east, it stands out but the countries in the middle east become a blur since they are very similar.

 Wonder of phones hurt the experience? Keeping our head in the phone instead of observing the surroundings, even music listening may distract from the local sounds.

 I did have an extremely detailed journal with sketches and random tickets that detailed all 42 days of my first ever trip, and I read I sometimes and it’s so funny how starry eyed I was. Honestly, that journal along with sketches and little exercises I made for my future self was an absolute gem and I’m so glad I decided to do it. 
 I tried to journal my next few trips but I never finished a single one after that, but reading through the first journal I wrote feels like travelling for the first time all over again.

Reddit,How to introduce someone to backpacking and not overdo it?,kuukumina,"Yes you should post this in JapanTravel. I suggest that you make reservations for your accomodation few months before and book the Shinkansen tickets when they are available, before going to the county. Japan is not a country where you just go in and out, as things get sold out and it is very different culture than SEA where you can travel more in a whim.  
 I think otherwise you can just leave the planning for the trip for more spontaneous style of travel.  Japan is also a great country to get lost safely and try new things as they come. Don't google too much for it to become the checkpoint trip! 
 I think knowing that you will have roof over your head and important transfers booked would give the peace of mind to your friend too. They are the basics, after that you can just do whatever. 
 Last time I went to Japan, I just decided the island, then kinda randomly searched accomodation from the more rural area and ended up in a random place for me. Then I kinda forgot about it as I booked couple months before going. All when I went in was a surprise. It was pre booked but still very unplanned. Only thing I had googled was that it was a great cycling region so I booed also electric bicycle. I did touring at the area and didn't have anything planned and it was just great. I didn't google anything of the area before. Ended up climbing a volcano, visiting several onsens and getting to know the local cuisine.

 In the most random ways possible, to be honest. Especially when I was younger, people naturally noticed a foreign child in a random Vietnamese village and approached us even before we did. But even as i got older, people all around the world are as curious about you as you are about them and want to talk to you, know where you are from, why you're visiting, what you like about their country and sometimes maybe practice their english with you. 
 But generally speaking, just talk to people. Ask a vendor what he's making because you've never seen it before. Ask your taxi or tuktuk driver if he has a favorite restaurant he thinks you should check out.  If you are in a local restaurant and the menu is in a language you don't understand, just order whatever the guy at the next table is eating. Most of the time the conversations start by themselves, and many of them don't even require a common spoken language.",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1p4mbxg/how_to_introduce_someone_to_backpacking_and_not/

The Japanese train pass system is expensive but excellent and gives you some reassurance for transportation without having to be locked into a specific schedule. I can't remember if I needed to book advance tickets or not but I would double check your specific route. At least have a general plan for which trains you intend to take, be aware of the schedule, and try to book out your hotels/hostels in advance... nothing sucks like being stuck on a sketchy train platform or arriving to your destination with no idea where you will sleep. If booking your accommodations ahead is stressful to you, you can always pick free cancellation options so you can change plans if needed.

 plan one-three activities a day for sure — that way you’re still doing things that you’ve been wanting to do but leave room to check out the cute cafe you walked past or stop and walk around and ask a local for a recommendation  
 for your last paragraph about the vain Instagram posts vs taking it too lightly — yes you are a tourist and it’s not vain to want to take pictures and visit touristy things (that is NORMAL). people want to feel better about themselves and call themselves travelers and not tourists but at the end of the day if you’re not living there you’re going to be a tourist in some aspect so just embrace that. also, a trip is about what YOU find important — if you take it lightly, that’s fine and it’s YOUR trip. it doesn’t matter if you ""missed"" seeing a certain thing, if you are happy with what you did and taking a trip that’s all that matters.  
 
 for me, I don’t like planning and did a month trip where I told myself I would do one thing a day, but if I felt like sitting in a park for three hours after that and journaling and finding a place to eat that was fine. and there were some days where I would sightsee the whole day and take a bunch of pictures and whatever. it doesn’t matter 😭 
 But it is very thoughtful of you to want to accommodate your friend, and I think this can be a  simple compromise of making a very very very basic outline and booking refundable things and then you can plan more the day before in a go with the flow manner.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1p4mbxg/how_to_introduce_someone_to_backpacking_and_not/

 This is more than enough. You can do it with $150 for two. You can use the extra money to stay in better hotels. Ask the hotel to arrange a driver for you. They will have the responsibility to keep you safe. You can find an official guide at most attractions. Ask the ticket sellers if you need one. 
 
 We are both young blond women 24&18 
 
 Wear conservative clothes (buy some cheap cotton Kurtas on Amazon or wear hiking blouses and trousers.). A large, dark colour hairband and hair tie will be useful to avoid attention. You can also use a wide-brim hat or sunglasses for the same purpose. You will need it for the sun anyway. If a large group of men ask you for photos, politely decline.   
 Maybe this is overthinking, but I would avoid being outside after it gets dark. Have dinner near or at the hotel at 6 pm and go back to your room.  
 I suggest you start in more tourist-friendly places like Kochi, Kerela. Stay on Fort Kochi and hop on the public boat to visit other places. The metro is not crowded and is very easy to use. After that, you can move on to other places like Mysore, Hampi or Odisha.

Reddit,Have Hostelworld Reviews become useless? Every hostel is a 9.8 nowadays.,JoseHerrias,"I've been wondering this for a while. I have a little theory about this, and I think it's to do with the personal nature of a hostel, compared to something like a hotel. There are a few factors though.  
 In a hostel, a good time is very dependent on the people and the staff, you are more involved as a guest usually. So when that vibe is good, or there is a good crowd, it becomes easy to forgive or forget the cracks here and there. Those good reviews become a reflection of the emotional side of it, and not the actual facilities.  
 When I read bad reviews, they seem to emphasise specific issues, such as hygiene, missing amenities and bad atmosphere. It becomes easier to pick out problems and also nitpick. I notice these sorts of reviews are way more common for hostels that don't have a real common area, and less of a social vibe overall. They read a lot more like a hotel review.  
 Then there is the fact that you are more likely to have interacted with owners face-to-face in a hostel. I can't comment on the psychology behind it, but I know we tend to tone down our negativity towards something when anonymity is gone and we humanise whatever it is we are reviewing.  
 Reviewing is also pretty stark, as most people don't leave them. A very negative experience is going to spur someone to leave that review. I mostly see negative reviews in the 1-3 range, and it's rare I see anyone leave reviews in-between 4-7.  
 I've read about people being given incentive to leave a review, but I've never seen this first hand. I think I've only ever seen one place give a free drink and another gave a small discount, which is pretty bad form in my opinion.  
 If I'm a bit iffy about a place, I'll look up a Google or Booking review, they tend to be left by more mature travellers in general, so there's more emphasis on actual things I might care about. At the end of the day, a lot of Hostelworld users are young, and they are going to be a lot more satiated by a decent common room or social experience than someone in their 30s who doesn't drink or go out.  
 I could be completely wrong, but that's the conclusion I came to. I had the same curiosity a while back, it seemed every hostel was this award winning bastion of the travel world, only to arrive and see the most standard hostel experience going.",13,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1obs7j6/have_hostelworld_reviews_become_useless_every/

If you've some hiking experience, recommend the Salkantay solo incase you find the tours expensive. Can do it for nearly half the price and its hard to get lost on the hike. You meet other solo travellers or groups on the way and you're never truly alone. Whatsapp the accommodations in the villages a couple days out. 
I did it in late Feb and early March and was lucky with minimal rain and fog but met people who did it just a few days prior under sleet and got a disappointing foggy Machu Pichhu. Plan some buffer days for the places you truly care about. For offbeat towns around Cusco look at ones in Sacred Valley like Pisac or a trip to Lares 
 Highly recommend doing the Uyuni tour from Tupiza, its a 4 day tour and you get to certain popular spots earlier since its done in reverse compared to the ones starting in Uyuni. Basically building your way to the salt flat. Did it with Tupiza Tours, my guide Abner was brilliant. 
Experience Titicaca in Copacabana over Puno, the hike in Isla del Sol was calming. La Paz and Bolivia in general are very underrated. Personally loved Sucre but lot of people find it boring, the dinosaur footprint was alright nothing to write home. Tarija was another great town. The live mine tour in Potosi gave lot of perspective and a probable stop for a day or 2 on the way to Uyuni from Sucre. 
In terms of safety, I found pockets of La Paz & Lima shady but generally safe otherwise wrt places mentioned here. Granted this is from a male POV",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pj7woa/1month_peruboliviachile_in_january_solo_female/

 I loved the southeast (check current travel advisories to see if there is anything that might invalidate your travel insurance). Gaziantep for food. Sanliurfa for mosaics and cultural sites. Mardin and Midyat. Dara. Mt Nemrut and nemrut crater/golu. Van. Also Kars and Ani.

Reddit,Crossing Turkey west to east! Any advice?,annamnesis,"Some other random thoughts on safety: 
 I'm of east Asian descent. I felt safe as a woman. I got some casual racism (squinty eye faces from men too old for that shit and teenagers screaming corona at me) but nothing that felt dangerous so I just didn't engage and carried on with my life. 
 I generally take my social cues from local women--- turkish women were traveling wearing far more fashionable and revealing clothing than me everywhere I went, but they also were all at least in pairs if not accompanied by a male partner or family member--- so I erred on the side of hiker-chic. 
 I do dress relatively  modestly (loose clothing, shoulders and knees covered outside of swimming--- you're fine in a bikini on the beach on the coast) as a default, and did carry a scarf in the southeast but never ended up covering my hair outside of mosques. People kept asking me if I was an archeologist in their attempts to place me, especially in areas with only domestic tourism (Dara particularly). I thought it was great. 
 Scams I'm told are common in touristy areas but I didn't really engage with hawkers in Istanbul and always clarified prices before ordering anything at restaurants. I took public transit to avoid taxis in Istanbul.

Reddit,"I feel torn between Pakistan and the West. Just need to get this off my chest, and a couple of questions, looking for advice.",earthuser001,"Reality is you are no longer just Pakistani but also a Canadian now. As for "" Pakistan main jo apniyat mehsoos hoti, woh kahin aur nhi hoti.""  part of the issues is that we tend to isolate ourselves within our community and not broader our circles. Jab unko apna nahi samjho gay tu how do you expect them to show that apniyat. I am not saying go out all partying and drinking/dancing all night but pick up activities that you are fine doing in your own circles right?. That "" apniyat "" will come when you make an effort. Example, when we go out, my friends (mostly east asians and latinos) know i need some halal/veg options, I have may be told them once when we first went out.  Now, whenever we go out they make sure whichever restaurant they pick it has to have some options for me without me ever asking (that's  apniyat  to me). They can easily hangout without me but they make an effort.     
 As for culture, I have hosted them for iftar dinners and on eid weekend and they have invited me during christmas season for gift exchange. I randomly send them pakistani mangoes and food i make and I can assure you those plates have never returned empty. We find days to get together for board game nights and go out for movies. it happens over time and yes you will have to make an effort for it happen. That apnaiyat you say will start to show up now and then in subtle ways. I had to be in hospital for a bit last year and they were all in the waiting room and even brought food haha and no i never asked or told them to do any of that.",3,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1oz6a9n/i_feel_torn_between_pakistan_and_the_west_just/

Canada, seemingly has everything compared to Pakistan, so to see the level of things that are happening in Canada despite it, is both saddening and concerning. not to mention a lot of the homelessness you encounter in Canada, is due to substance abuse. like you said, you've never been to canada, and clearly havent seen the extent of the issue its become, so maybe better not to comment on it? the things ive seen in toronto on this particular matter (in very normal, busy areas of the city jbtw), have often been more disturbing than things ive seen in Pakistan in this regard. 
 again, I mentioned this quite a few times, this post is not to make it seem like I dont like living in Canada, or that im ungrateful for the life i live here, Alhamdulilah, I’m very thankful for everything.

You may not be one of them and that is great but almost every other day there is a post on this sub saying how Pakistan is the dream to live in if you have money...

Who work for cheap because they are forced to and I am tired of people pretending it is okay. Just saying this may get me downvoted to oblivion but it is a fact. 
 Life for a normal person is very tough in Pakistan. I have friends from different socioeconomic statuses in Pakistan and it is much easier to meet the ones who are doing well (for building a community, or having the sense of brotherhood etc) than those who are working more than 10 hr days just to make ends meet.

Reddit,"I feel torn between Pakistan and the West. Just need to get this off my chest, and a couple of questions, looking for advice.",taha_omar,"First, I must ask you to watch the drama Parwarish (its on YouTube). It explains exactly 💯 what you're experiencing. 
 I am 45(m) and I am in Chicago USA (citizen by birth, lived 20 yrs in Karachi and 25 years in America) and I've been planning to return back to Karachi Pakistan very aggressively. I have family in both places. The biggest challenge, is of course a steady income, and then the kids/spouse refusal to move back ... so if you orchestrate and time it perfectly (i.e. earned/saved enough while the kids are under 9yr old) then you have a shot to move back to Pakistan ... remember URDU is a necessity for O/A level and Inter/Matric system, and as a Pakistani NICOP/Passport holder child, coming from the west, they need at least 5 years before be able to pass the urdu exams in Pakistan for university admissions (else you'll be forced to send them to university on overseas quota seats which have gotten pretty expensive, about $20,000 per year).  
 Convincing your spouse to move back will be the greatest challenge of all times (I'm experiencing it first hand, everyday), however as another person mentioned, Islam is still available in Pakistan, your kids will have a better shot at life, they will speak urdu, they will have their roots and culture and identity developed, they can easily be doctors or engineers by age 22, they can easily get married insh'allah, away from drugs, alcohol zinaa, haraam food, poor financial decisions, being unnecessarily college dropouts. In addition, your marriage will stay protected there (I'm seeing a lot of divorces happening here in USA on a daily basis), arguments/fights over worldly stuff, commercial and materialistic society is destroying marriages and family values, eating us from inside, and pushing us to haraam, to ribaa and hefty interest and mortgage houses, credit card applications and car and student loans. 
 On YouTube, there is a clear video/fatwa by Dr. Zakir Naik, that living in non-muslim West (i.e. USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, Europe etc.) is absolutely Not Permitted. May Allah 🕋🤲🏼 bless us all with courage and audacity to move back to Pakistan 🇵🇰 Insha'Allah",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1oz6a9n/i_feel_torn_between_pakistan_and_the_west_just/

Reddit,"Itinerary Review - 33M, 3 Weeks in Bali (August 2026)",Interesting-News-300,"You can absolutely do Bali without a scooter — I didn’t ride one either. Private drivers + Grab/Gojek worked fine, especially since you’re staying put in each place. Sidemen for 6 nights is great if the goal is stillness; it’s quiet, spread out, and drivers are used to short local trips. Munduk trails are straightforward solo, just start early and check weather. 
 Kintamani is more about the landscape than social life, so I’d treat it as a reset stop. Amed is where I found the easiest, calmer social connections — dive cafés and low-key guesthouses naturally bring people together. 
 For your last stop, Jimbaran is more walkable and relaxed than Uluwatu if you’re not surfing. Good choice for winding down. 
 One thing I’d say overall: Bali travel is easy, but conditions (traffic, weather, ceremonies) can change plans day-to-day, so your slower pacing is exactly right. Hope this helps!

I almost died in cambodia because I thought I could just hop on a motorbike without instruction, always thought the brake was only at the foot, but there is also a hand brake.

Stepped off the water taxi, crossed the Rialto Bridge to an 800 year old pensione where my room was on the fourth floor and of course no elevator. After the travel, and the endless stone steps, and the 90% humidity, by the time I drug myself and my luggage into my modest but spacious room, I was done. I cleaned myself up, put on pajamas, and did not emerge for 24 hours. I slept, I hydrated, I ate a little, and I unpacked and organized. I rested and rested. It was the best thing I could have done. My body didn’t care that it was in Venice, it cared that it was utterly exhausted and dehydrated. All to say, never regret giving your body what it needs. It should be your main influencer, not some stranger on Instagram with carefully staged and curated photos. So stop feeling guilty about your rest time and instead be proud of yourself for traveling and for acknowledging what your body needs in order to function.",27,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvnbwj/unpopular_opinion_the_first_24_hours_of_a_solo/

Reddit,unpopular opinion: the first 24 hours of a solo trip are actually kind of miserable (and that's okay),warpus,"for the longest time i thought i was just bad at traveling. i would force myself to go out and see sights immediately because i felt guilty for 'wasting time'. which just led to a meltdown. 
 
 I totally understand that feeling of guilt, it probably happens to all of us at one point.  You gotta be realistic and manage it though  
 
 once i stopped trying to be the 'perfect traveler' on day 1, the anxiety dropped so much 
 
 IMO it's a mistake to try to be a perfect traveler on any day of your trip.   I think you'll get a much better experience if you instead do everything you can to maximize your trip  before your flight .  Be a perfectionist in your prep work and you'll have more flexibility in being more chill on your trip while still having an amazing time and not feeling like you're missing out on anything.   
 For me that means doing a lot of research about the culture, food, people, history, etc. of the place I'm travelling to, plus research on potential points of interest, restaurants, cafes, cocktail clubs, events, museums, parks, statues, stadiums, used book stores, i.e. everything I am ever interested in when I travel PLUS other suggestions from a variety of sources.  I put all that on a map and I see where I will probably want to travel to.  Some parts of town will have concentrations of markers, so those are more obvious potential destinations.  I colour code stuff so that the stuff I want to see most sticks out.  That allows me to research the logistics in terms of the transportation, where to stay, and anything else that's specific to the stuff I'm most interested in.  Doing all this prep work ahead of time gives me the best possible (from my pov) prep for my trip.  I'm going in knowing a lot and having a map of things to do and see.  I know how the public transit works.  I know what's closed on which days of the week.  This means I don't have to do any of that research while I'm there, all I have to do is look at my map and check my notes.   
 The way this plays out on a trip, before going to sleep on a random day on my trip I'll peek at my map and get some quick ideas for the next day. 
 When I wake up I usually just know where I'm going.  It's that part of town and I need to jump on the subway and a bus to get there.  Once there I'll have 4 specific high priority markers in the area, 15 other ones, also an interesting market, a couple parks, and a potentially interesting walking trail by the river.  A solid destination option to keep you busy for a number of hours perhaps. 
 There's probably a lot of other stuff in the area I don't even know about.  My research is only meant to guide me to parts of cities and regions.  Once I'm there I can walk around and explore.  You'll usually find other cool stuff along the way, you just have to keep your eyes open.  Don't stare at your phone and follow your markers like a zombie.   
 Different factors will guide you in different ways, but the main point is that you don't have to stress.  Yeah, travel can be often stressful from time to time anyhow, but you don't have to make it worse by attempting to have a perfect day every day.  If you put in the work ahead of time, you can half-arse some days and still have an amazing time.  If you end up having a crappy day, because they do happen, you can be sure that you have plenty of potentially amazing days left.  You know that you can half-arse the rest of your trip and still have a high chance of having a good day on any random remaining day.  You've done the research and you are ready.  The law of averages will throw you a number of good days your way, you've done the work and have maximized other factors.  Life can throw BS at you, and that you can't control, but the parts you can control you have maximized ahead of time.  Now you can half-arse some days and still not feel bad about it. 
 That's my approach at least.  The way I see it, I don't have time to do much research while I'm travelling.  Yeah, I end up doing a bunch anyway, but I can be a lot more relaxed about things.  I don't have to run around like a chicken with its head cut off to get some perfect selfie at some rock everyone takes selfies at.  I don't have to prove to anyone that what I'm doing is worthy.  I  know  that it is worthy because I have done the research, I have seen the pictures, and I know I will have an amazing time even if I only visit 15% of the markers I researched and only 25% of the ones I visit are actually interesting. 
 And hey, sometimes it's also fun to just NOT do the majority of that research and just fly in blind.  Yeah, you need to know visa requirements, safety levels, vaccine requirements, etc.. but it can sometimes be fun to go to some city not knowing much about it, then just explore it with your nose as you go.  Meet people and ask them where to go.  Get advice from locals about what to do next.  Walk around aimlessly around interesting parts of town and see where you end up. 
 In the end the expectations you have of a trip will dictate how successful you think the trip was when it's all said and done.  If you expect every day to be perfect, with perfect selfies in perfect spots every day to show off on social media, that will probably lead to anxiety and other bs.  If you dgaf and fly in blind and expect to have a ""we'll see what happens"" kind of trip, that's awesome, go for it, that experience has merit if you are ready for it.  If you want to feel more in control, do the research ahead of time, and fly in with the expectation that your trip will rock.  No matter what happens or how it plays out, it will be a memorable experience.  Don't expect perfect days, trips are often in some ways up and down.  Expect that you're ready to take on each day with the sort of focus and chill balance that puts you the most in your element.  Use the research done to maximize your experience without blowing out your back. 
 
 am i just dramatic? 
 
 I don't think you are dramatic.  We all have different tolerance levels for things, such as long flights, and we all react to things differently.  There's a lot of stuff we have in common, most of us get tired after a flight for instance, but you gotta forget about what other people think.  Focus on your own personal needs.  If your body mind and soul are telling you to take it easy when you land at some new destination, listen to it!  Some people are better at dealing with {whatever scenario} than you, some are worse.  Figure out what your body needs and then plan your trip logistics around that to some extent.  For a lot of people that means taking it easy on the first day.  How that plays out depends on your own personal needs and other internal factors. 
 
 does anyone else have a 'survival ritual' for arrival day?  
 
 Here are the ""first 2-4 days"" ""rules"" I have for myself, custom-tailored for my own travel needs over the years: 
 
 For the first 2-4 nights book a comfortable bed in a quiet hotel that's central or close to a subway stop.   I tend to spend a bit more on these couple first days in the country, in terms of accommodations - I am willing to pay a bit more to have a higher chance of a quiet comfy & restful experience.  The longer the flight, the more nights I usually book 
 Whenever I end up landing, I stick it out until 10pm-1am and go to sleep then.  Even if I'm super exhausted and landed early. If my plane lands after midnight but before 4-5am I consider spending one night at a hotel at or near the airport.  The Hanoi airport for example has a capsule hotel right at each of the terminals - My flight touched down at 12:20am, it was so nice to just pass out right at the terminal in a quiet and relatively comfy bed.  When I woke up at 8am I checked out and jumped on a bus downtown and went to my new hotel. 
 I go in admitting that the day I land and the day after that will be slower days, while I'm getting my feet wet and re-energizing my reserves.  Expectations are lower for these days, especially that first day, depending on when you touch down.  That very first day is basically a writeoff day. I make the most of it though!  I tend to focus on finding some nice restaurant and a park to walk through beforehand, maybe some commercial area near your hotel.  Most hotels let you leave your bags if you arrive early, so no matter what, after checking in and making myself at home, taking a shower, my first actions in a new city are going on a walk near my hotel.  I strategically book hotels that are in locations that have walkable ""stuff"" around it, and enough of it..  There needs to be enough stuff I can explore on foot casually in the couple blocks surrounding the hotel. 
 After waking up in a new country/region/city for the first time, I usually try to go somewhere that will require me to use the public transit system.  I want to figure out the basics of that while it's still early on in the trip, but after I've had a chance to recharge a bit and get a bit more coherent.  As a result I do try to book hotels that are not too far away from a rapid transit station of some sort. 
 
 These ""rules"" have served me well.   I can't remember the last time I felt like I was missing out during the first 2-3 days of a trip.  Those days are just by default lower expectations days for me.  Recharging and getting to know a bit of your immediate surroundings is what I'm focusing on.  And since I've done so much research, I actually end up seeing a decent amount of stuff during those first couple days regardless.   
 You've also got to be flexible with this stuff.   It's okay to have a chill day every once in a while.  That  can  make the rest of your trip a lot better, if you spend some time to recharge a bit, if you need to.  But sometimes you can power through stuff and not feel like you are even rushing or getting tired.  Listen to your body mind and soul, and don't listen to influencers on social media",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvnbwj/unpopular_opinion_the_first_24_hours_of_a_solo/

I'm right there with you friend, especially when it's a solo trip. I figured this out after a few solo trips in my early 20s, and recognizing the pattern and accounting for it makes my experience so much better. I call it ""the pit of despair."" I'm tired, I'm overstimulated, my tummy is upset, and I've had to solve problems and experience unfamiliar environments nonstop for the last however many hours of transit time. I want to be having the whirlwind trip of my dreams, but all I can think is ""oh my god why did I do this to myself."" 
 When I started expecting this as part of the process, I stopped feeling so upset about it and just allowed myself the grace I need, knowing that the feeling will pass. Zero expectations, checking in with my body and my brain and putting no value judgment on what I need to transition out of that heightened state. Clearly this isn't something everyone experiences, so frankly kudos to us for going out there and exploring the world even knowing it's not always easy. 
 The older I get and the more I travel, the more I refine the process and find additional little things that help with the transition. If you haven't already, you might consider things like taking a taxi to your accommodation rather than public transit, and if it's international travel and you'll arrive early in the morning after a red eye, consider booking your hotel room for the day before so you don't have to wander around like a zombie waiting for your room to be ready. 
 Also, ignore the judgmental attitudes on display in a lot of these comments. Frankly those people should be embarrassed for being so rude and sanctimonious.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvnbwj/unpopular_opinion_the_first_24_hours_of_a_solo/

 But yeah, when we finally realized that day 1 is just a wash and we need it to have zero pressure our travel got much better.

 that said for me the exhaustion of stumbling around looking for where my hotel is kind of is partly the magic because it's a bit of how i get a feel for the atmosphere of the city. it's a bit comforting to be in a hotel district where you see any number of other fools also beating their feet with their suitcases, but it's just as well to find yourself lost outside where you should be to get a sense for how people actually live there. as long as you don't get in trouble in that process, obviously.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvnbwj/unpopular_opinion_the_first_24_hours_of_a_solo/

Reddit,unpopular opinion: the first 24 hours of a solo trip are actually kind of miserable (and that's okay),Anzai,"I love the first day of travel, but not because of all those false expectations you mentioned. I’m just excited to be somewhere new and to be done with the boring flight part of it. Once I check into a hostel or hotel I like to just walk around the city with no particular purpose and enjoy being somewhere I’m not used to. 
 I will say that I’m lucky in that I pretty much never get lonely. I’m perfectly content being alone for extended periods, and I actually kind of need it fairly regularly. I’ve done many multiple month or year long trips and I don’t recall ever feeling homesick or lonely once, despite being fairly sociable and having a good friend group in my regular life. 
 So I agree with you on just turning up and taking it easy. Hell, I often do that for several days, just hanging out and not doing anything touristy, but I don’t agree about feeling panic and regret. I always feel elated and excited just to be there, even if I am just sitting in my room doing nothing and eating trash.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvnbwj/unpopular_opinion_the_first_24_hours_of_a_solo/

Did I spend a bunch of money and time getting here for no reason? Jet lag adds to these negative feelings.  
 What I do is calm down and think about how this is only a temporary thing. I'll only be here for 1,2,3 weeks and then I'll be going home like nothing ever happened. And what's so great about being home anyway? What am I really missing by not being at home for a few weeks? Plus as long as I'm on vacation I don't have to work!

Reddit,unpopular opinion: the first 24 hours of a solo trip are actually kind of miserable (and that's okay),orangemoonboots,"I think if you base any expectation for anything on what you see on instagram, you'll be disappointed. I love solo travel because I like to travel solo. Also I generally make plans for every meal and every day, but I don't necessarily observe the plans, if that makes sense. Like, I PLAN to land, find the place I'm staying, and then usually just go eat or something and have an early night, but if for some reason things go awry or I'm not down for it, I give myself permission to deviate from that and do what works. Same for literally any part of my itinerary. 
 I love solo travel specifically because there are no expectations. I can do what I want, when I want. Also, depending on your travel day, that can be a long day. You probably need rest and decompression time depending on what it took to get there. My last solo trip took 32 hours from my door at home to my destination accommodations. You bet your ass I took some time to decompress after that.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvnbwj/unpopular_opinion_the_first_24_hours_of_a_solo/

 For me that is extremely relaxing. 
 Oh and I don't live at hostels and only hotels as for me solo travel means I do not want to be around people. I like being solo, having my own oasis of peace. 
 Also, finding your accomodation is only stressful if you use train or buses.

I arrive, get to my hotel and shower - feels like this gets rid of some of the travel anxiety. Then I mark some convenience stores and restaurants on my Google maps - nothing too far and complicated, all within a 20 min walk or so. And then I head out the door into this new city I've arrived in and see how far I get. If I'm nervous and not feeling the vibe straight away, I find one of the shops and get some water and snacks and I can retreat back to the hotel and have dinner there. More often than not though, by not setting myself any big goals, I'm much less stressed and usually find a restaurant to enjoy some local cuisine. 
If you are nervous and still fancy a McDonald's, don't go to the nearest one, go to one that's a longer walk away. This allows you to familiarise yourself with the city a little without putting a lot of pressure on yourself. (You'll appreciate it the next day when you head out sightseeing, that this new place feels a little more familiar already). And then I head back to the hotel to plan out the next few days, and have an early night.  
 Also, don't cram like 10 activities into one day, you'll be exhausted and won't enjoy yourself. Give yourself a break - it's a holiday after all. And if you don't get to do everything you wanted, and like the place, it's a good reason to come back. If you don't like the place, well, then having done all the extra things would probably not have made you like it any more.

Reddit,Can We Really Handle Tourism?,TerryMakichoott,"I'm a foreigner living here and tbh I think mass tourism would have a negative effect on society.  Nepal is pretty culturally similar to Pakistan as well as India and they're massive tourist hubs, but the difference between Pakistan and those two countries is the scam culture is far far less in Pakistan, tourists here generally aren't degenerates looking for ""a good time"" involving drugs or sex tourism.  Pakistanis are still hospitable and generally treat even non-muslim foreigners pretty good (I have no complaints about hospitality despite being here for close to 5 years, though I'm a convert to Islam).   
 In Nepal and India I get people walking up to me asking me to buy drugs, go to a ""spa"" (only common in the touristy parts of Kathmandu, in India it's pretty much everywhere).  Rickshaw drivers harass you into getting rides at inflated rates.  Drunk foreigners and drunk locals fighting at and outside the bars stumbling around like morons (you'd have to build bars and nightclubs here for mass tourism, unfortunately the reality is most of the Europeans traveling to Asia see it as a giant brothel and frat party, it's bad in Bangkok, really really bad). 
 It's already fairly easy for foreigners wanting to see beautiful and historical sites.  I just have a guy up north I use (made sure to verify he was in the tourism business and he has no issues showing me his card or CNIC).   
 But yeah the airports here are a hot mess.  The worst I've ever been to.  There's no order at all, it's pure chaos.  Though on the bright side I can get through pretty fast, only annoying thing is the porters grabbing my stuff when I tell them no and cab drivers trying to do the same thing and then charging 10 times the fare an inDrive would charge.  I'd rather walk than take a cab driven by those haramkhors.",6,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1n84ld2/can_we_really_handle_tourism/

Reddit,"Fuerteventura, Playa del Cofete: a stunning and eerie beach.",nomadchak,"I wrote a piece on this villa for a travel article. It was closed the day I was there so I could not go in. You may find my research interesting: 
 Villa Winter was built in 1937. The Spanish government says it was built in 1946. This suits their story, but ignores the truth. The Villa was built by a very interesting character, a German engineer called Gustav Winter.  Winter had strong links to the Nazi party in the early days and there seems little doubt that prior to - and during - the Second World War, he was a fully-fledged German agent.  
 In 1936, he concocted a cover story that he wanted to industrialise the remote Jandia peninsula, showing basic plans to build a cement factory and a fish factory. He was quickly able to obtain a lease for the entire peninsula from General Franco. But the projects never happened. They were just a convenient front for something much more important. As a Nazi agent, he had a plan. Whether it was his plan, or something agreed in Berlin that he was to control, we'll probably never know. That's all been lost in the mists of time. But, significantly, in that same year, he travelled to Berlin. Rumour has it that he returned to the Canary Islands with 'suitcases of cash' given to him by Hermann Göering. The Nazis had plans for the Canary islands. They offered great strategic value. And, because of the massive military help Hitler had given Franco in the Spanish Civil War, Franco owed Hitler. In 1939, an agreement was reached between Franco and Hitler to turn the Jandia Peninsula into a secretive military zone.  
 All local population were evicted, a long fence was built and the villa was built by forced labour from Franco’s concentration camp. People reported hearing regular blasts for building tunnels.  
 Germany lost and Nazis scattered all over the world.  
 Gustav Winter’s name appeared in 1945 on a list drawn up by the Allied intelligence services and sent by the US State Department to Spanish government at the time. In this document, the engineer’s name appeared along with 103 other Germans suspected of being spies and who were asked to be expelled and repatriated to Germany. Shortly afterwards, Winter, who did not leave the country, acquired Spanish nationality.

 Tibet overland tours are plenty, you can find them in Kathmandu. No need for a Chinese visa for this route as you'll get a group tour visa. BUT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A VISA IT'LL CANCEL WHATEVER CHINESE TOURIST VISA YOU CURRENTLY HAVE. 
 The problem is getting the overland Indian visa. You can't use the e-visa. 
 So basically you can do Turkey, Iran, Pakistan then China (you'll need a Chinese visa in your country if you can't enter it visa free in this case). 
 Done. Super easy.

Reddit,Plane-free travel from EU to PRC without crossing Russia?,ppden,"I hope you have a lot of time :)  
 Visas are going to be the trouble. The difficult ones are Russia, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Tibet.  
 The Russian route could be possible, e.g. through Estonia, but getting a visa may be difficult, and travelling in Russia right now can be risky. 
 Azerbaijan's land borders are closed, so a Southern route will go through Iran, or Syria, Iraq, and Arabia. Crossing from UAE or Oman to Pakistan is not straightforward, you'll have to find a ship, which may take a lot of time. 
 The best bet is through Iran. The visa is a gamble - for some it is easy, others get rejected for no reason. 
 Turkmenistan requires a tour company to get a visa.  
 I central Asia it will be easy - you can cross to China through Tadsjikistan, Kyrgyzstan, or Kazakhstan - all are possible with local transport. Trains run from West China, so the rest is smooth. 
 Another good option is Pakistan to China through Karakorum highway. 
 India, Nepal, Tibet is possible. You will need a Tibet Travel Permit and a group visa - so you'll need a tour company e.g. from Nepal. I've heard of visa rejections, so make sure everything is ok before choosing this route. 
 I expect you would use 3 months for the travel. More if you want to enjoy it. Planning and visas need to be done asap.

Reddit,Advice and tips for first time backpacker,Kananaskis_Country,"1.) Same way as you'd deal with it at home. 
 2.) Depends entirely on your nationality. Very easy to research at the appropriate Embassy. 
 3.) Easy to research. Public transport is excellent at all your destinations. 
 4.) Hostelworld, booking dot com and Agoda. 
 5.) Depends on the destination, of course. International Travel 101 is to have a  minimum  of two unrelated credit/debit cards (with little/no foreign transaction or ATM fees) and a little stack of emergency back-up cash. Use credit cards whenever you can, especially for large purchases, and a debit card to withdraw local currency as required from an ATM. China is on its own no-cash system. Download WeChat, Alipay, etc. in advance. Easy to research. 
 6.) That's an incredible vague question when you give zero info or context in terms of budget, likes/dislikes, interests, etc. 
 Bottom line: It appears you've done little/no research thus far. Google is your friend for all the normal stuff then come back with specific questions. 
 Have fun with your research and happy travels.",5,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1p69oeh/advice_and_tips_for_first_time_backpacker/
Reddit,Advice and tips for first time backpacker,Stock_Car_6619,"Only for China 
 
 Sick:  Just go directly to a major hospital. China doesn’t have a GP system—you register straight with a specialist. The efficiency is very high. 
 Visa:  Depends on how long you’re staying. If it’s within 144 hours, you don’t need a visa. For longer stays, you’ll need to apply for one. 
 Transport:  Public transport and Didi ride‑hailing. Open your Apple Wallet and add a transit card—you’ll see that most of them are for Chinese cities. Note that while many cities have their own transit cards, they’re interoperable, but local cards often come with discounts. So just open the card for the city where you’ll be staying the longest.

 
 Example: In Australia, it’s like being able to use an Opal card in Melbourne, but without the local discounts. 
 
 Pay:  Alipay is the most popular. It supports direct binding with CommBank cards for automatic settlement. But I recommend opening a card like Revolut, then creating a CNY account and buying some CNY when the exchange rate is favorable. 
 Place:  You’ll need to tell me which cities you plan to visit ;) 
 Other: 
 
 Network:  Convert your Australian SIM to eSIM. Foreign visitors can only buy physical SIM cards from Chinese carriers. Of course, you can also find reasonably priced roaming plans. Note that Chinese carriers’ networks don’t allow Google/Meta apps. 
 Hotels:  Best to book via  Trip.com . In China, Trip orders are prioritized by hotels, meaning you’ll get the best service. 
 Agoda:  Prices are cheaper if you enter via Google Maps. 
 Maps:  Use AMap. Google Maps in China is very outdated and nearly unusable. 
 WeChat:  Download and register in advance. Many tickets and information are booked or published through WeChat. 
 Chargers:  Three‑prong plugs are the same as in Australia, so you can use them directly. Two‑prong plugs follow the Chinese standard (also compatible with US). Once you arrive, go to a Xiaomi store and buy one—it’s cheap and works well. 
 Power banks:  Don’t bring ones bought in Australia. Buy a new one in China. Domestic flights require power banks to have CCC certification (China’s standard), otherwise you’ll lose them at security. Power banks in China are very cheap, usually 50%–80% of Australian prices.",3,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1p69oeh/advice_and_tips_for_first_time_backpacker/

Reddit,14-hour overnight layover in Hong Kong - is it doable??,Vanilla_Quark,"Doable, but time is tight.Taxis use cash, and they're not expensive. Buses - especially the small mini-buses are cheap. The train from airport is great,  but not as fast or direct as a taxi, and you don't have time to waste when you arrive.  
 HK is pretty safe, you should be fine if you're smart. Try the YWCA near central for accommodation. Short cab ride to night life in Wan Chai, Central and Lan Kwai Fong - but I'm not expert in that regard!  
 In the morning, recommend taking the funicular rail up to the Peak and do the Morning Walk - under an hour to walk around, it's a circuit around the mountain behind HK Central - it's beautiful. The Peak Tram funicular rail station is not far from YWCA. That is an amazing trip up the mountain!  
 Take the minibus back down to YWCA, get your bags, taxi to Central and do an in-town check-in for your flight. They'll take your bags to the airport for you, and you'll be pre-checked in for your flight. 
 Whilst downtown, look at the trams. Iconic, but slow. Take a photo, and next, catch a Star Ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui. That TST side of the harbour is best for night lights photos, but you're likely to be too late for them when you land. Have a walk, catch the ferry back, catch the airport train.  
 At the airport before you go through customs, stop downstairs (arrivals floor) and eat at Crystal Jade. Double boiled chicken soup can (probably) cure cancer.

 Do your thing, enjoy the evening. The peak tram doesn't start running 7 or 730. So you might miss literal sunrise unless you take a taxi. It would only be like a 10 USD taxi or less from LKF/Central. Sunrise will be like 6:45am or so.

Reddit,9 Days in Egypt- part 1,karileeart,"Yes, the constant attempts to sell you something get tiresome. Yes, sometimes the price changes after you’ve agreed upon a rate and it’s annoying. This is not unique to Egypt and is not an uncommon experience in areas with deep poverty that rely on tourism. I didn’t realize actually before visiting that their currency crashed a few years ago and hasn’t recovered. People are struggling and trying to make do. Egypt always gets hate here for this aspect of the culture - but IMO it’s so inconsequential relative to the wonders of its historical sites",14,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pwjh4v/9_days_in_egypt_part_1/
Reddit,9 Days in Egypt- part 1,PorcupineMerchant,"Agreed.  
 I think a big reason people get a bad impression of Egypt is because there’s so much hustling, and those who haven’t been to a similar place interpret it as being dangerous.  
 I totally understand why someone following you down the street trying to sell you something could be interpreted as dangerous, but it’s not.  
 The trick is to just not respond. Their main goal is to is to get you to say something, because starting a conversation is the first step towards a sale.  
 As for changing the price, I just made sure I was  very specific  about things. For example, if you’re negotiating for a camel ride, make it clear you’re paying to get on the camel, go to a designated spot, get back on the camel, and be returned to where you left from.  
 Otherwise you can run into “Oh, I thought we were just negotiating to come here, not to go back too.” And make sure it’s clear you’re paying in Egyptian pounds, not British pounds or US dollars or anything else. I think if people get the impression that you know what you’re doing, they’ll be honest about things.  
 But most people still wind up getting pressured for tips, which is just part of the culture there. They do it to each other too. You wind up having people trying to do services for you all the time — I even had people hanging around the security checkpoints at the airports, trying to pick up luggage and put it on the conveyor belt.  
 My philosophy was that if they were doing something I wanted or something I asked for, then I would tip them. If not, then no.  
 I think the key to Egypt is just doing your research and knowing what to expect. Or you can do things like you did, and go on organized tours.",5,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pwjh4v/9_days_in_egypt_part_1/

Reddit,"What countries/cities did you expect to have few tourists, but turned out very touristy when you visited them?",FinancialSailor1,"I feel the “influencers have ruined everything” take is massively overblown.  
 You can insert ___ city and someone will say influencers have ruined it. Riga, Bucharest, Paris, Madrid, Oslo, Rome, Pristina, it doesn’t matter. There is bound to be someone on the internet saying they were there 10-15 years ago, and now a 25 year old instagrammer has ruined it.  
 At some point you have to at least put some of the blame on: 
* The world has like 1 billion more people than it did 15 years ago
* The world has gotten richer and more people travel
* Covid (yes it was 5 years ago) gave people FOMO and it hasn’t ended
* The internet in general gives people way more information on traveling and has made it way easier. You can’t just blame the Tik Tokers. 
* The massively sized tour groups need some blame. I see way more of those than people with GoPros taking videos of ___ monument.  
 Yes influencers are a problem, but I refuse to believe 95% of people solely went to ___ city just to follow an IG itinerary.

Reddit,China trip,yguo,"Can you speak Chinese? If you can’t, I’d say a lot of those national parks and cities can be hard to navigate.  
 With that being said, if you are into mountains, Taishan would be pretty rad to visit. I did it last year early Feb (just before spring festival). It was not crowded at all. Tai’an (the city where the mountain is located) can be visited easily via the high speed railway (it’s between Beijing and Shanghai - two mega cities if you want to get that vibe). From the railway station to the hotel/mountain can be tricky to navigate though especially if you don’t speak Chinese. I’d say Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen are probably three of the most foreigner friendly cities.  
 If you are in Beijing, the Great Wall can also be cool to visit (which I did last year Feb as well). The trick here is that you’ll want to be there as early as possible (arrive before 8:30am when they open) so that you can avoid crowd. There’s no public transport at that time so your only option is to hire a taxi.

 I can agree with most everything you’ve pointed out. I definitely have some corners to round out!  
 I have to admit, I love the Kakwa 55 as a pack. It’s served me extremely well so far. But you may be right about knocking off some weight… or a lot.  
 I want to upgrade to the Pro version of the X-mid but the cost climb to weight saved I’m still trying to justify.  
 Zenbivy is comfy, I try to convince myself each time that quality sleep is worth the weight…. I’m working on it! 
 I’m really trying to work on food. I did a YouTube video of weight loss on trail after specifically working macros to a dime… food is my struggle point for real.  
 Leukotape is wrapped around my trekking poles. Didn’t make a separate comment on that but 100% not going without it. Yea I took a ton of trail skittles (Advil) the past two trips. Definitely don’t need that much but also hiked with a group of 11 others on my last trek… medicine man lol.  
 The chair can go. I agree. I found so many other things to sit on that a pound is a lot. But hiking without fishing…. Especially in the Sierria’s hmmmm I might take the PT before leaving it behind.

 You can probably sell some of your gear on  r/ulgeartrade  and  r/geartrade  to make some of it back. 
 Apropos your tent, I could not believe the difference when I switched to a dyneema tarp from my old silnylon tarp. You would enjoy the xmid 1 pro, and unless your friends sleep with you, you don't really need a 2 person tent. I also just find it less annoying to set up a single wall shelter. 
 As far as food- what percentage of your food was good fats when you were losing weight? Repackage olive oil into a smaller container and you can squirt it into your dinners. Also; more nuts. SULers are eating almonds and craisins and hitting their macros. Gear skeptic has an amazing series on backpacking food that covers a lot of this...I should probably watch that again. 
 I realize I didn't talk about your clothing choices. (Now here is where the light hearted ribbing can come in.) I'd roast your clothing, but I think your outfit does it for me. Joking aside, what is the 7 oz  Ten Thousand Over Zip  ? Is that a midlayer grid fleece or something? I guess you could save a few oz with an alpha midlayer instead. 
 Wait, I didn't realize how much extra clothes you were bringing. You have a long sleeve shirt, a short sleeve shirt, and a sun hoody? Just have your sun hoody be your base layer, then use a grid or alpha mid layer, and you have the ghost whisperer for the puffy. 
 You're bringing shorts and long pants- you're better off bringing shorts that have a liner in them (can skip underwear), and using enlightened equipment copperfield wind pants or just cheap amazon dance pants for bug pressure or sun exposure, and keep your underwear for sleeping. I prefer a high merino blend for underwear for sleeping when possible. Your current pants are 12 oz, which is outrageous.

 Between my phone (Filming and FarOut), inreach mini, GoPro 8 or 11 (depending on the hike) my Garmin watch, and flashlight I was recharging an item or two every other day and not able to charge my power banks for 8-9 days.  
 I have seen several people with solar panels along my hikes, but I seen them experience some issues that made me glad to have my banks. I think the entire conversation could be argued other ways if I didn’t film for my YouTube channel.  
 If the water is included in the base weight… yes it’s an accident and an oversight! Thanks! 
 Zenbivy has come out with an “Ultralight” series… I’m trying to justify the cost. I’ve seen a few other brands similar but none are “throw away money” on average. Zenbivy is ridiculously comfortable, it’s hard to steer away from something that works simply due to weight… when the cost/weight ration for the next jump hurts the gut.  
 15lbs of food is eight days. My last high was the High Sierra Trail (HST) no resupply, 12 person group, 8 days.  
 I tailored all of my food off macros. Hitting the right amount of fat/protein/carbs over simply looking at calories. I have also done a YouTube video on macros and the outcome of muscle preservation after a 19 day hike based off what I ate… eating this way is not light I know. I’ll watch some gear skeptic videos and see if I can make the food lighter while balancing out some weight issues! Thanks for pointing me that way!

Reddit,"Roast My Gear List (…but like, kindly?)",swatsnpr4,"Great breakdown, thanks for sharing your setup! I really love my Zenbivy Light Bed, and for me the benefits go beyond just weight savings. A couple highlights:
    • Efficiency: Quilts like the Zenbivy cut out the “dead” insulation that gets crushed under your body in a traditional bag. That’s insulation you’re hauling but not actually getting warmth from. With a properly rated pad underneath (R-value matched to conditions), the system ends up being lighter and warmer per gram.
    • Modularity: I can swap components depending on season. Colder nights? I’ll pair the quilt with a higher R-value pad and close it up tight. Warmer nights? I leave it more open and vent easily. It’s like running one system that adjusts across multiple ranges instead of owning two or three bags.
    • Side sleeper perks: This is the real kicker for me. A “bed” system with sheet + quilt moves with me instead of tangling me up. My hips and knees don’t feel like they’ve been pressed into plywood all night. It’s actually closer to sleeping in a real bed than cocoon wrestling.
    • Comfort vs. weight trade: Your 1640g setup is solid and a great price point, especially in Europe. My Zenbivy rig is a touch lighter and packs smaller, but the big win is comfort on multi-day treks. After 15–20 miles, shaving a few grams is nice… but sleeping like an actual human and not a burrito is gold.

Apparently there was a misunderstanding as the lady thought less quantity of sweets would be packed in those custom trays (what the staff had guided her as per her claim), but when she got those trays, the staff said they would need a lot more sweets to fill them to make them look good (hence increasing the weight of the sweets and therefore the price, obviously). The staff there was  so  rude, that it did not feel like he was interested in resolving her query and giving a good shopping experience to that lady. If i was in her place, i would have cancelled my order then and there, considering how rude and condescending he was being, given that I am paying the full amount that they have asked and not getting those sweets for free.

 So not a lot of time, in the grand scheme of things. 
 After flying in to BWI, I’d hop in the car and cross the Bay Bridge (if you aren’t too scared of bridges). I haven’t been there in forever, but people talk about  Cambridge, Maryland  as being neat. There’s a lighthouse, historic district, and a wildlife refuge. It’s pretty cute. Then I’d head to  Chincoteague.  It’s a longer drive than it seems. After that, I’d go up the  Delaware seashore: Lewes, Rehoboth, Bethany.  there’s National seashores, shopping, breweries, good food. Lots to do. I’d personal drive up Delaware to the middle of the state,  Smyrna and Dover area.  there’s actually a big Amish community with cute markets and more nature. Continue up to the  Claymont Sub Shop in Claymont, DE  for some of the best cheesesteaks in the area. Take I-95 down south towards Baltimore from there. Personally, you’d probably like  Havre de Grace, MD, or Chesapeake City, MD over Rock Hall. My personally recommendation is Havre de Grace.  Bomb ass food, lots of little shops, nature, and a lighthouse! Then go to BWI.

It's a cultural place for cultural travel (Pai was a bit too hippy/young crowed for me, nothing really that impressive around IMO, I liked going all the way to Mae Hong Son, at the Myanmar border, tho) 
 Koh Phangan is ""just"" a tropical island, so it's about spending your time on the beach, ok you can drive a scooter in lush greenery and do a full moon party or something, but it's more vacation than travel. 
 I would personally do both, 2 weeks is just enough to have a cool first full taste of what Thailand is. 
 Start by Chiang Mai to get full of culture, spent like 5 days (skip Pai), than fly to Koh Samui (or around there) to go to Koh Phangan for a week of beach time (or try Koh Chang, closer and maybe more accessible from Bangkok ?) Bangkok at the end is better, to do some souvenir shopping at the week-end market, do the Wat Pho and get a massage there. 
 I'm also gay and went there solo in my 30's, meet plenty of other gay travelers on apps to eat together or share day visits, you're going to have a great time whatever you choose :)",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ph7wlr/thailand_solo_travel_advice/
Reddit,Thailand solo travel advice,Careful-Way3733,"honestly both options are solid but for your first time i'd lean towards phangan... the variety there is perfect for what you're describing and you can literally walk from chill morning spots like around hin kong near joy beach villas to party areas when you want that energy   
 chiang mai/pai is amazing but december can be pretty crowded with tourists and the social scenes tend to be more segmented. what kind of music do you play because that might actually tip the scales one way or the other",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ph7wlr/thailand_solo_travel_advice/

Am an early to bed early to rise person so didn’t bother with the nightlife, and didn’t really venture off the beach. Took plenty to read, lots of music on my phone and had a lovely time.

 Hoi An and Da Nang are close enough you can combine them really, I'd just pick one if you're short on time and travel to the sites in the other. Da Nang is a big city where you'll probably be staying on the beach, Hoi An is a cute old town that is probably the most touristy spot in Vietnam now. Both are fun, depends which vibe you prefer. Visited the marble mountains and My Son ruins around here which were both worth a visit. 
 Hue is nice. Half a day or more in the old imperial city is worth it for sure. There are some other tombs and such around that we didn't get to visiting  due to weather.

Reddit,Solo female traveller in her 30s with 2.5 months for Southeast Asia – looking for beach gems and advice,Travels-Throwaway,"These are places I've been to/heard about but haven't been/missed out that are purely for beaches: 
 Heard about but haven't been:
- Phu Quoc island. Very touristy 
 
 Da Nang. The main reason tourists go here is because these have some of the best beaches in Vietnam (from what I've heard). 
 
 Missed out on:
- Con Dao Island. Found this place looking through Vietnamcoracle website and I wish I knew about this place before I got to north Vietnam. 
 Been to:
- Hoi An. Stay in the old quarters and take a grab to the beach, rather than stay next to the beach. I wasn't too wowed by the only beach I went to. It was very commercialized and there were coconut boats for 50m either side of the entrance and it was too hot so I went back to my hostel and dipped in the pool. Not much of an opinion to go on but most people said Da Nang's beaches were better 
 
 Quy Nhon. Nha Trang but less busy. I was the only tourist and went to the beach once, turns out going to the beach at 6pm on a Friday is how you find out what all the locals do once the weekend starts (it was VERY busy, so I walked to the end of the really long beach and went back to the hostel). If you want to go to a great beach place with few tourists, go here (just not at 6pm on a Friday) 
 Mui Ne. Should've gone to a better hostel that was beachfront and in the main part of town. I only had access to a 50m strip of beach which wasn't nice, had enough rubbish that would be off-putting for some but wasn't that bad to me personally (for SEA standards) and all the locals went to that spot in the evenings. I'd either skip Mui Ne or if you reaaaally want every beach spot you can get, go to a hotel with beach access in the main beach area",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1mg61v6/solo_female_traveller_in_her_30s_with_25_months/

Reddit,Solo female traveller in her 30s with 2.5 months for Southeast Asia – looking for beach gems and advice,Vordeo,"I'd probably just recommend El Nido and Coron in Palawan.  El Nido's beaches and scenery, while Coron is beaches and wreck diving, if you're into that.  Both are gorgeous, and you can take a ferry between both sites.  There are direct flights between both of those and Manila, too. 
 Other than that, Boracay's the most famous beach in the Philippines, and it is worth going to, but it's mostly a party place with a gorgeous beach.  May not be exactly that you're looking for.   
 The second biggest city in the Philippines is Cebu, and that island has good sites around it too.  Oslob and Malapascua are on the same island, and Bohol is a short ferry ride away.  Bohol specifically has a great mix of beaches, other nature, and culture.  I mention Cebu primarily because travelling around the PH generally means flights, and Cebu is one of the major flight hubs.   
 Other major beach / island sites are Siquijor and Siargao.  And if you like mountains / hiking, Sagada and Banaue up north in the mountains are worth a visit, though frankly the rides up there can be brutal.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1mg61v6/solo_female_traveller_in_her_30s_with_25_months/
Reddit,Solo female traveller in her 30s with 2.5 months for Southeast Asia – looking for beach gems and advice,Both-Valuable-5133,"Like you, I've also been around Asia a bit (Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Philippines, India). My suggestion, considering your current situation and where you've been - I'd say the best choice is the Philippines.  
 
 You mentioned that you usually only get two weeks off from work, and that the opportunity you have now is golden. With that said, the Philippines is not as easy to travel around in as for example Thailand or Vietnam, or even Sri Lanka tbh! You got flights, ferries/boats, and minivans (not those VIP ones like in Vietnam haha). There's no trains or quick busses. Therefore, with the time you have at hand, I'd suggest you to explore the Philippines as you have TIME. There's no stress to squeeze in things within a 2 week period. You have to take a 5h ride? No worries. Got to stay 1 night in a city to transfer? No worries. Got to take a long ferry? No worries. You got time.  
 
 Which leads me to point 2. The Philippines consists of over 7000 islands (which you probably know due to your research haha). But that means you've got so much to discover, the beaches and islands there are unbeatable compared to both Vietnam and for example Koh Rong in Cambodia. And if you want, there's mountains and Volcanos that you can trek in the north, so you got both! And since you've got time, you can explore so many different places on different islands.  
 Now finally, we got point 3. The Filipino people are the nicest people that I've ever encountered during my travels. Without a doubt. So if you love the local vibe, I'm sure you'd have an amazing time exploring the country, small towns, beach gems etc as you'd encounter them along the way and they'd be more than happy to give recommendations or help out.  
 I believe it would be your best bet destination-wise to find that rhythm you're mentioning. 
 My most recent trip was this Christmas/NYE where J traveled for 1 month in Vietnam, going north to south and ending the trip on Phu Quoc. Went to north of Phu Quoc (more local, a village with only two places to stay) and yes it was nice, but I've had better beaches/nature. Koh Rong is a Cambodian island you can almost see from the north of Phu Quoc (and yes it's nicer and, but still ain't the Philippines).  
 Sri Lanka is beautiful as well, super tropical (think yellow sand, big waves, palm trees) and has more untouched beaches. But it's a place you can visit in the future during for example a 2 week trip.  
 I'm actually going back to the Philippines this Christmas/NYE for 5 weeks. Closing in on my thirties, usually go on a 4-5 week trip each winter to get away from the hectic work environment so I'm looking forward to it!  
 Take the recommendation as you will, you'll figure something out!",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1mg61v6/solo_female_traveller_in_her_30s_with_25_months/

Reddit,"Suzuki Alto airbags didn’t deploy, got pushed by police to start the car — what a day in Lahore",hil_ton,"Yes, in most modern vehicles, airbags are designed to deploy regardless of whether the seatbelt is fastened. The primary purpose of the airbag is to provide additional protection in the event of a collision. However, some advanced safety systems may adjust the deployment of airbags based on seatbelt usage. For example, the airbag may deploy with less force if the seatbelt is not fastened to reduce the risk of injury from the airbag itself.

 It's important to note that airbags are designed to work in conjunction with seatbelts to provide the best possible protection.

In fact, without a seatbelt, you could be thrown into a rapidly opening frontal airbag, which could injure or even kill you.

Reddit,Which country do you feel more like a guest than a tourist?,GodLeftMeOnRead,"It was affordable but not as cheap as expected. Do not expect discounts on luxury, or even western midrange goods - they are full price. Gold jewelry is no longer as affordable there, taxes have been added to its purchase so I prefer to go to places that still have it tax-free. Do not expect local handcrafted goods to be greater in quality than western options except for in a few markets like perfume or suits. (Quality is much better here in these areas) 
 Safety was good, but there are Pakistani beggars and they may try to scam you. Stick to newer nicer neighborhoods like Diriyah in Riyadh or Al-Rawdah in Jeddah and to malls, you will feel safer here - tall and pale westerns like myself get disapproving looks in smaller towns like Al Kari or Ad-Dilam. Stick with groups and tours when leaving cities and try to book stays only in tourist focused hubs. 
 Hide religious symbols if you wear them or do not bring at all, cover all tattoos especially crosses because these can put you in prison. You may be fined or deported if you attempt to enter their holy cities. Do not do anything that may be associated with Drug culture, while westerners are less likely to be executed here the Saudi Government still executes thousands a year for captagon, coke, and hash. 
 Otherwise Saudi is a very nice place and the people are very welcoming. Show interest and respect for their culture and you will go a long way. If they attempt to tell you Jesus was a Muslim just smile and shake your head, saying anything about it could send you to prison. 
 Try to use your right hand whenever possible when interacting with locals. Do not talk to Saudi women unless their wali/mahram is there, as doing so is seen like trying to steal their family’s property (and if they are talk to that man first) unless they are working at a store or something like that (they may still call a man over or only type on their phone to talk to you.) Typically if they are not veiled they will be less strict about these things.

Reddit,Rant: What is Wrong with the Excise & Taxation Department Punjab?!,Ill_Help_9560,"I had to deal with the rented shop sealed due to tax. My father paid property tax to a visiting excise inspector regularly but the month after he died, shop was sealed. We couldn't find any receipts in his belongings.  
 Renter told us that the excise inspector apparently kept the money himself and many shops in the area are now sealed. My father, it turned out was too trusting. We were hit with property tax for 4 years too. On our protest and demand of face to face with the inspector, we were told that he is transferred. Max they could do (short of legal complaint by us) was installments.

 Your aggregate merit on induction in MBBS will be used. People having Domicile other than Lahore can apply and those with the highest merit on admission will get first dibs.

You can 'buy' an allotment from a senior where you can get a single room but I would suggest getting a tri-seater with your classfellows.

 The male perspective since the woman life freedom movement has completely shifted as well. I rarely felt eyes on me in a ‘sexualizing’ manner. Is people stare it’s usually because tourism is less common in Iran today.  
 Since leaving the US and moving to Europe (this makes a big difference because Americans are barred from visiting Iran) I have met so many young people both men and women who have told me they have visited Iran and absolutely loved it.

And road safety can be an issue; many shared taxis and hired drivers advise travelling in convoys. You gotta watch your back in Tana, too. 
 Having said that, I'd 100% recommend visiting if you ever get the opportunity! It's such a unique part of the world, the wildlife (lemurs, sure, but also hundreds of other species) is like nowhere else on earth, and the diversity of the landscapes makes the 8th island pretty incredible. But even if you're the type to typically turn your nose up at tours, maybe consider making an exception in Madagascar, especially if you have limited time.",7,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pjqrjv/the_easiest_and_hardest_places_ive_traveled_solo/

Its not cheap to get there to begin with, I very much second the sentiment that if you've already shelled out for the plane to get there, just go in on a tour or hire a guide, its really not crazy expensive. Also, take candy or something, kids get super excited when you go through more remote areas and they know to ask for it. Not related to anything, but one thing ill never forget, in several places, some of the younger kids would want to touch me (or in one case, their parents would ask if the kids could touch me) because they wanted to see what my skin felt like (im a white guy, so it was relatively novel for them). I also second looking past the lemurs.

It may feel good to see kids all excited about it, but honestly, it's ethically one of the worst things you can do. Not only is the candy bad for the kids, but, more concerning, families will keep their kids out of school and send them to beg for change and trinkets (and candy) from tourists. It breaks my heart when I see all these kids running up to the tourist vehicles shouting ""bonbon! bonbon!"" but ethically, the best thing you can do would be to support local community projects that fund schools and other necessities.

I could see it becoming an issue in the way you described if tourism became a real industry there, but there was only one town where kids were clearly being used in that way, and it was actually for water because in that town clean water was a rarity. Idk, maybe im overly downplaying it, but of all the ethical issues I had with travel there, and there were plenty, I dont really feel like a few kids getting a sweet tart or something is high on my list.

Reddit,"The Easiest and Hardest Places I've Traveled Solo (Thailand, India, Iran)",segacs2,"I'm a 5'1"" tiny woman too and I've been to Morocco, and to India twice. Don't let people's negative tales spook you; you can easily visit both if you have the right mindset and plan accordingly. I didn't find either country particularly hard to travel in. 
 I've been to around 70+ countries and I'd say that ""hard"" is really subjective. Some places are hard to visit on a shoestring budget, but become much easier if you can afford a little luxury and some creature comforts. Much of Africa comes to mind; I just got back from a 3-week trip to Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya, and while East Africa has limited tourist infrastructure for budget backpackers, if you can afford to join a safari tour, it's one of the easier places to travel since you'll be chauffeured around everywhere and catered to to almost an uncomfortable degree.  
 Other places aren't particularly pricey, but can be ""hard"" in terms of language or cultural barriers; I'd say to this day, China stands out as the hardest place for me in terms of communication barrier. The language barrier is pretty absolute; in most of the rest of the world, everyone muddles through with a mix of a few words of each language, some smiles, some hand gestures. In China, people just stare at you like you're from mars and if you don't speak any Mandarin or read Chinese characters, it can be pretty daunting. Also, a lot of systems require local banking apps and local ID to navigate, e.g. buying train tickets and such. It can be quite complicated without a local guide to show you around. 
 Some countries are ""hard"" for women in particular because of lower gender equality, restricted rights, or just a higher harassment culture. This is why many women are put off by places like India or Morocco, though in both (especially Morocco) I found the attention to be merely annoying, not dangerous or threatening. In India, it really depends on where you go; I visited the Golden Triangle and found the harassment culture higher there, but in the south (Tamil Nadu and especially Kerala) it was very chill and everyone just let me be. A lot of people also find India hard because of the sensory overload that OP mentioned, but honestly, that's one of the things I love the most about it. Again, it comes down to personal mindset. 
 And then, there's ""easy"" and ""hard"" for particular categories of people. Food restrictions, for instance: As a semi/mostly vegetarian, India is one of the easiest places in the world for me to find good food. I found it to be much harder in countries like Argentina, which have an extremely meat-heavy diet and didn't really have much in the way of veggie-friendly options, at least not back when I visited in 2009. If you're a happy carnivore, you may not even notice this one.",8,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pjqrjv/the_easiest_and_hardest_places_ive_traveled_solo/
Reddit,"The Easiest and Hardest Places I've Traveled Solo (Thailand, India, Iran)",Justice_C_Kerr,"Disagree about china, but that depends on where you go. Larger cities are easy. You don’t need local ID to buy a train ticket. You do need to often book in advance. It’s certainly helpful to download WeChat or Alipay beforehand, and now non-Chinese credit cards can be added, as you would a payment wallet, so you can scan QR codes and go.  
 I don’t speak Mandarin and have been to China more than 10 times. Translation apps help a lot, and in places like Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, stuff is often in English and many younger people speak the language as they learn it in school whether as kids or going to uni abroad.  
 I took a few small tours to visit ancient villages, go on hikes, yoga retreats, etc. which made the whole transportation and language barrier easy to overcome if going to more remote or smaller cities.  
 Sure people might stare, especially in smaller villages, but so what? I’ll smile and get a smile back in return. Never once as a woman have I felt unsafe when travelling. In fact, safer than in most western places. Annoyed as hell sometimes, but that’s pretty normal anywhere you have a crush of people trying to get in a queue etc.",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pjqrjv/the_easiest_and_hardest_places_ive_traveled_solo/
Reddit,"The Easiest and Hardest Places I've Traveled Solo (Thailand, India, Iran)",segacs2,"It depends on where you go, I suppose. I did a trip about 10 years ago starting in Beijing and heading westward onto Kashgar and then onward to Central Asia. I legit think it would've been near-impossible without some sort of local guide or connection to facilitate arrangements, even then. These days, travelling to Xinjiang has gotten even more complicated, as the Chinese government seeks to cover up a lot of the evidence of the human rights abuses that are taking place there with the local Uyghur populations.  
 I've heard that some of the bigger cities of Eastern China that have historically had more international/expat populations are easier for foreigners to navigate. Also, back then, it was very difficult to get a working phone with VPN or to use foreign credit cards. It might be easier now, especially if WeChat or AliPay now allow foreigners to create accounts. Translation apps would've helped so much, too, but alas they really weren't a thing in 2015. 
 So yeah, a lot depends not only on  where  but also on  when  you go. 
 (And I never found staring to be hostile or negative, especially in China where people were generally pretty low-key about it. When I talked about blank stares, I meant it more in the context of trying to facilitate communication across the language barrier. Even hand gestures and counting signs are different in China than in English-speaking countries. After all, with 1.4 billion people and most tourism being domestic, not foreign, why  should  China learn to adapt to the west? They figure (and not unreasonably) that it ought to be the other way around. But I really struggled to learn even a few words of Mandarin; tonal languages throw my brain for a loop.)",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pjqrjv/the_easiest_and_hardest_places_ive_traveled_solo/

If your goal is $1500 for a month, obviously those aren't the places to go but if you assume a shorter visit, maybe during shoulder season or with some deals, cook/go basic on meals & tours, you can have a good trip. 
 The same could be said for ""dangerous"" countries which IMO, is an ever moving & individual target anyways. You can't skip your way out of all risk but you can certainly reduce it through prudent behavior, selective tours/accommodations for you, and being honest about conditions (e.g. don't go to a place if conditions are bad, do go knowing it will be -20 so you come geared for that).",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pubdt6/how_do_solo_travelers_manage_in_more_advanced/

 Xiahe and Langmusi had great yak bbq just about everywhere, Furong we didn’t eat in but they had a very authentic river fish market. Our best meals in Hunan were usually in some random restaurant or house on the side of the road. 
 My favorite regional cuisines are definitely Yunnan, Xinjiang and Hunan, although I think Dongbei food is massively underrated within China and practically unknown in the US. I’m a big fan of simple yet hearty meals, probably my best meals were at local Nongjiayuan where I’d stay while doing backcountry hiking on the Wall, mostly north of Beijing in Hebei. 
 The food scene in Beijing itself is incredible, it would take a lifetime to cover. Some of my favorite meals were Yangrou chuar in the hutong within the second ring road; there’s about a million tiny restaurants and even just a guy with a blow dryer and grill sometimes.

Reddit,Which Destination should I choose?,North_Conference_250,"Hey! First off, congrats on finishing school! I’ve traveled extensively in both regions, and I’m going to be the voice of logic (and a bit of adventure) here. You should stick to Japan + Central Asia. 
 You mentioned you are fluent in Russian. Girl, do you realize what a game changer this is? Central Asia is arguably one of the coolest, most underrated regions on earth, but the 1st difficulty for travelers is the language barrier. English is not widely spoken outside the strict tourist bubbles.  
 The Hiking Issue: You are worried about missing adventures/hiking because you are solo. Because you speak Russian, you can easily negotiate with local guides, join local hiking groups, or arrange transport to trailheads that English speakers struggle to find. You won't be ""stranded""; you will be one of the few tourists who actually understands what’s going on. 
 The Vibe: You mentioned wanting to ""ground yourself."" The Pamir Highway or the yurts in Kyrgyzstan are the definition of this.  
 And Japan is actually the  best country in the world for solo travel. You will meet people instantly. Plus, hostels in Japan are very social.

Reddit,Feedback on 3-week India itinerary,AfroManHighGuy,"I agree with the other commenter about all the precautions you should take. May is right before the rainy season begins in June. So expect hot and humid weather. I’m also from the US and I’ve gotten sick every time I’ve visited India whether it’s from the food, water, or just heat. The locations you chose are all tourist spots and should be safe overall but expect crowds as the weather is nice and people will be visiting. I’d recommend doing sightseeing early morning and and evening. The afternoon will be peak sun and heat and I’d take that time to rest. Have you booked accommodations? As a tourist, I’d stay as close to the town center as possible. Less chance of getting sick from local food, getting robbed, or being in any type of bad situation. I have family in Mumbai who was able to book train tickets for me, however I’ve also just showed up to the station and bought tickets at the counter. Make sure you buy first class or AC train cabin, as the normal ticket will be for a crowded non-AC section which will be terrible.

Reddit,Feedback on 3-week India itinerary,AfroManHighGuy,"For the heat, the most you can do is just stay inside during peak hours which is usually between 12-4pm. Try to visit places during the morning and evenings when it’s a bit cooler weather. For precautions, I’d bring sunscreen, sunglasses and make sure to wear a hat. The sun is different there and it will cause you to have a heat stroke if it the sun is hitting ur head directly for a long time. If you have to be outside during the peak hours, stay hydrated. I like to drink coconut water and there are street vendors everywhere selling coconut water. It’s cheap and it works in keeping you hydrated and giving you a sugar burst.  
 I don’t have experience staying in hostels in India. I’ve mainly stayed in hotels or with family. I don’t know your budget, but what I will say is that the USD goes a long way in India. For example, you can book a 3-4 star hotel for about $70 per night depending how close to tourist areas you are. In the US, any 3-4 star hotel would be a minimum of $150-200 per night or more. A benefit of staying at a hotel is the food and water will be safe. On one of my trips, I ate all my meals at the hotel just so I don’t get sick. Hostel might be cheaper, but be sure to check reviews for cleanliness, bugs, bathroom pictures, food options on site or nearby, etc.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1je2ke1/feedback_on_3week_india_itinerary/

Reddit,First solo trip to Orlando from UK in October – advice needed,Neil-Ward,"I can be wrong of course, but given that Orlando is a car-centric gigantic sprawl and the opposite of densely populated, it will likely not be the best spot to go solo. I have also grown up here my entire life.  
 Obviously, you already are set on coming here and you've been here before. I would suggest definitely visiting other places in the state, like St. Petersburg and if you can schedule accordingly probably going up to springs like Wekiva or Devil's Den. A LOT of the trip for you in general will be driving and it will take up a significant chunk of your trip.  
 If I am being 10,000% honest, however, any joy or fun found in Orlando as a spot is best accompanied by other friends. Solo travel in the US is better geared toward cities like Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle etc. due to density walkability etc. On top of that, I'm not entirely sure if you will be able to realistically spot the right crowd to want to accompany you for an adventure. A lot of the good nightlife or bars to meet people are mainly college-aged broke people or young professionals OR rednecks. Neither of the (usually, obviously I can be wrong) three have the time to prioritize a little adventure with a British stranger. They would love to, but they probably just can't. 
 Miami is the #1 spot to solo travel in the state but it is expensive and usually draws a more assholey crowd.  
 I'm not trying to be cynical or anything by the way as I write this, you definitely can find what you are looking for elsewhere, and you certainly may find it all here and I could be totally wrong, but for what you want the odds are a little stacked against you.

 I only threw that last one in because the theme parks really are the backbone of most Orlando trips.

 To answer your questions:  
 1, yes its safe to travel, you might find people staring a lot but Thats because they dont see a lot of white (USA / UK/CAD) person in that specific area.  
 2, I dont think vaccination would be compulsory, but I can always double check to make, if you want?  
 3, there are a lot of different laws but in our country, we are super cool with White people. Just make sure not to carry/drink any kind of hard drinks during your visit in Pakistan.  
 4, yes going back would be hassle as the boarders open for a specific time frame. You can always get an AirBnB(with super host) or a hotel (please dont get a cheap one) for an overnight stay.

 So it, should be fine. I’ve had my white af British friends (f&m) visit multiple times. They’ve felt safe for the most part. The general rule is to follow the same rules you would visiting any third world country i guess; don’t go out alone late at night etc etc. it is generally a low trust society, people can be kind but i would not rely on that. 
 As for vaccinations i think the general hepatitis ones are recommended but obviously consult a doctor for this.  
 Freedom of speech doesn’t exist in the same way (not that the US is the champion of free speech these days lol), the consequences are just not worth it. DO NOT talk about controversial topics especially around religion! Please this is very important.

 Just like India, Pakistan is safe and there is nothing to worry about except the overly friendly people (some might think it's creepy). 
 
 Lahore has a balance of heritage and modern facilities. I don't think you need to worry about it. 
 
 If you want to get a visa, plan a longer trip because it would be a useless experience. 
 The majority of women in Pakistan don't even wear headgears themselves. No problem with what you're wearing but making sure showing lesser skin means getting less pervy (harmless) looks. 
 Rather than hiring a guide it would be better if you have a friend/acquaintance to show you around.

Reddit,"3 months south Asia, what would you do?",BlackStumpFarm,"Not sure if this is still feasible, but here’s my recommendation based on my ancient history. In 1972-3 my girlfriend (now my partner of 53 years) and I sailed from Darwin to Dili in Timor, then backpacked through Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, India, Nepal and Africa. Our favourite part of those many months was hitchhiking the east coast of Malaysia. We would simply ride along until we spotted a tiny village on the coast, then ask our driver to stop and let us out. We would immediately be swarmed by a mob of happy kids. Using our crude sign language and a few halting words, we would ask where we could eat and sleep. They would invariably direct us to a simple home where the hostess would show us a thatched cottage and agree on a very reasonable price for three meals per day. After extensive travel in over 70 countries, I’ve yearned for years to return to Malaysia to determine if that magical simple life is still possible. If you try it, please let me know! Perhaps others seeing this post will be able to provide an update.",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1p44hvr/3_months_south_asia_what_would_you_do/
Reddit,"3 months south Asia, what would you do?",mikeigartua,"Three months in Southeast Asia is a fantastic amount of time to really dive into the culture and find those secluded spots. Since you're keen on those quiet, remote islands with surfing and diving, Indonesia and the Philippines are definitely solid choices, especially looking at the January to March window. For Indonesia, consider heading east from Bali to places like Lombok or the Gilis for a start, but if you want  really  remote, maybe look further out towards Flores or even Raja Ampat if your budget allows for it. Flores has Labuan Bajo as a base for Komodo tours and some amazing diving, but you can definitely find quieter spots away from the main hub if you venture a bit further. Surfing can be a bit more challenging to find in the super remote spots without some specific research, but it's there. In the Philippines, Palawan is the obvious choice for stunning islands, but places like Coron and El Nido can get busy. For something truly off the beaten path, try Siquijor or even some of the lesser-known islands around Siargao (though Siargao itself is a huge surf hub, it's not exactly ""minimal tourism"" anymore, but the surrounding islands might be). Southern Mindanao also has some incredible, pristine areas, but it's important to do your research on current safety recommendations. Planning those specific two-week island stays can be the trickiest part, especially coordinating transport to genuinely remote spots. Sometimes booking a local dive or surf camp in advance for those kinds of places can simplify logistics and ensure you're getting legitimate operators. A good place to browse and even book some of those unique local experiences, particularly for diving or island hopping tours with verified reviews, is a platform like  Viator . It can give you a good idea of what's available and connect you with reputable local guides. Remember to factor in travel time between islands, which can often take a full day, especially when you're going remote. Enjoy the adventure.

Reddit,"3 months south Asia, what would you do?",mikeigartua,"Starting from Auckland for three months gives you a fantastic runway for exploring Southeast Asia. Since you're looking for that sweet spot of local culture, nature, and especially a quiet, remote island with surfing and diving, Indonesia and the Philippines are definitely strong contenders. For Indonesia, consider places beyond Bali's main spots. Think about the Banyak Islands off Sumatra, or even parts of Flores, like around Labuan Bajo, but then venturing out to islands further east if you want true remoteness, though some of those might be less surf-focused. Another great option could be the Togian Islands in Sulawesi for a truly off-the-beaten-path feel, though getting there takes a bit of effort. In the Philippines, Palawan is beautiful, but for quiet and remote, look at Siargao for surfing, or even the small islands around Coron and El Nido, though those might still have more tourists than you're imagining. For diving, Raja Ampat in Indonesia is world-class, but it’s a journey and can be pricier. If you're flexible with your timeline within the three months, you could also consider parts of Thailand or Malaysia that have less developed islands, like some spots off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, though the surf might be seasonal. To help narrow down activities and get a feel for what's available in these remote areas, you might find it useful to browse platforms where local tour operators list their offerings. It's a good way to see what authentic experiences, like local village tours or specific diving trips, are available and read reviews from other travelers. Sometimes, you can find unique boat trips to those really secluded spots that way. A platform like  Viator  could give you some good ideas and help you connect with reputable local providers who know the hidden gems.

Reddit,Too many options? Leads to no action,home_rechre,"This really resonates with me. I felt the same way, even at your age. 
 At 32 I went back to university and finished my last year (I dropped out in my twenties to, you guessed it, go backpacking for another year). After I got my degree, I started teaching English at a high school in Bangkok. I started to take it all more seriously, did a master’s degree, and moved into editing and writing work and lecturing at universities. I’ve worked in three countries across Asia and the Middle East and I make a pretty good living at it. It has allowed me to travel to some great places while simultaneously having a “career” (in the last couple of years I’ve been in Ireland, Laos, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Qatar). 
 Basically what I’m saying is that it doesn’t have to be either/or. You don’t have to give up a life of travel for a life of drudgery. You can combine the thrill of travel with a serious career. This is especially the case if you have a PhD—plenty of opportunities out there, especially in markets like China, Middle East, Central Asia, Singapore, etc.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pwu5o9/too_many_options_leads_to_no_action/

Just hang out in the common areas and you'll meet people. But if you're going for a dorm just to try it, a six bed is the max I'd say.

 This varies place to place. Some cultures are just far more insular than others. And if you have a hard time making friends at home you will find it even harder to make friends in a new place.

Reddit,Need advice about extended solo travelling,SofiaInSeoul,"1) Always do your research before booking a place. It's easy to filter out party hostels and stay in calmer places that are still okay for people who want to socialize. As an introvert myself, I don't particularly love hostels, but sometimes it's the only option available [I travel solo 9 out of 12 months of each year, and paying just for hotels can be quite hefty]. Read the reviews and see if it aligns with your expectations.    
 2) If you book the accommodation through hostelworld, there's a ""city chat"" where you can talk to other travelers and plan things together. I've used it to find people to go on hikes, but there are always people up for drinking, partying, et cetera. There's an app called Nomadtable that works similarly, and it's free. So, even if everyone in your hostel is an introvert, you can still find some party people to connect with.   
 3) ""What do people that stay in a country for e.g. a month, even do all day?"" I work most of the time, then enjoy and explore when I can. It's more like you're slowly discovering a city/neighborhood and less about hitting all the places quickly. But if you're not going to be working, and if you tend to get bored alone, booking a 30-day stay might be challenging. Keep your options open and go with the flow.  
 4) As for local friends, it really depends on where you're traveling to. Some cultures are much more open than others.

Reddit,Need advice about extended solo travelling,JohnDoeJohnDoe1,"Have solo travelled to many parts of the world and majority of the time my preference is to stay in hostels over hotels. I only ever book a private room which allows me to still have that alone time as an introvert. Solo travelling it forces me out of my comfort zone to engage other travellers or locals and love that about solo travel.  
 Have made some life long mates I've met at hostels over the years and have found Hostels a good source of valuable information hearing from other travellers who have been to other places that I hadn't planned for or known about (locally), good spots to grab a bite or drink, alternative ways to get around, prices etc.. but also share travel experiences where I gain insights on places to see in future.  
 Suggest looking at reviews for hostels that accommodate what you're looking for. Some are marketed toward 'party scene' where others are more balanced with some great activities planned. Many offer great deals on day trips or longer. Have found mixed age ranges in most hostels but age doesn't matter when everyone is there for the love of exploring a new country or city. I'm in my forties and still book hostels when travelling solo and always allow room in my itinerary for those random trips I usually come across when I stay in hostels.

 As far as how to fill your time for a month, I assume you won’t be basing in one city the whole time.

 I'm mainly concerned about the social aspect, especially in countries where they don't predominantly speak english, or when boredom hits especially since you're alone. 
 
 It is worth reminding you that you are solo traveling.  You should not be relying on others for entertainment or to do things with.  Even in hostels you will have times when it may not be very social, you don't click with others or for various reasons you don't meet many people.  There will be people in hostels who are packing everything they can into their two week vacation, so will be going out to 3am every night. You might be there and just want to rest.  Some people stay in a hostel for 3 nights to party, some will be staying there for two weeks, but you only meet them on their last night.  Personally I don't stay in hostels as I have the funds to afford reasonably priced hotels and resorts.  If you enjoy your personal space, long term staying in hostels may not be for you.  But everyone is different. 
 
 What do people that stay in a country for e.g. a month, even do all day?  
 
 Whatever you like. Don't go to a country unless you want to go there and have at least some plans. You are long term travelling you you can't expect to sustain doing things 10 hours a day.  Sometimes a day will involve laying on a beach, eating and then more beach and then more eating. Stress free and just relaxing. I can do this for a week at a time. 
 
 I get stressed when there's nothing planned, and it'll be hard to 1) plan things to do for a month or more, or 2) just wing it . Seems like there's a lot of research that needs to be done if youre in for an extended stay? 
 
 Some people are meticulous planners, while others will largely wing it. You need to find your travel style.  You will have lots of downtime to plan and research, but for me constantly planning and researching can be a pain also.  Often I will just book two weeks in a resort/hotel and just do zero research on my next destination so I can just clear my mind. 
 
 - If I wanted to make local friends, would you have any advice? 
 
 Locals generally have better things to do than meet tourists.  They have their job to go to, their friends to hang out with and their family to spend time with.  Again, you are solo traveling, so don't expect others to be there for your entertainment and friendship. 
 There have been posts on here about people who have dreamed big of solo traveling and taken a plane home after a week.  Others thought they were traveling long term and cut it short after 3 months after feeling burned out and missing socialising with their family and friends. Good luck.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1po73rm/need_advice_about_extended_solo_travelling/

 Scientific research that says 1 or 2 needs to be done?  I’m confused about what the question refers to.
And can you point me to some of the research? 
 I’ve been traveling solo for 15 years.  It can get boring, but it’s up to you to fill the time with what is interesting to you. 
 Making local friends:  I think this means staying in one place for a good amount of time.   Language can be a problem, but make friends the same way you do at home.      In places with fewer tourists it’s probably easy to make acquaintances as locals may be drawn to you as an outsider.   But you say you’re introverted , so that increases the challenge.  I myself don’t know how to  deliberately  make friends.  I’m sure there are “methods” but I would consider them manipulation if it’s not something I do naturally.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1po73rm/need_advice_about_extended_solo_travelling/

 To your second point - it won't get boring. I remember worrying that one month was too much; you could spend several really exploring one place. When you're not exploring, you're living life just like anyone else: cooking, running errands, travel planning, exercising, trying new things, catching up on your shows.

Reddit,Need advice about extended solo travelling,alnesi,"If you are a social butterfly, you should go for hostels. You don't have to stay in a dorm, you could also just get a private room in a hostel. Personally, I prefer peace and quiet, so I usually go for apartments, small guest houses or homestays and only book an occational excursion through a hostel or just eat/drink at their bar if I want to meet people. 
 Long-term travel is slower than a vacation. You neither have the energy nor the money to do something exciting every single day. I've usually stayed 4-5 days in one place, had fixed plans for 3 days and just winged the other two. Sometimes I hung out with people I met, sometimes I found out about a cool place/activity that I did not plan for originally and sometimes I just laid in bed all day watching Netflix and reading books.
Before the trip I made a rough plan with countries I'd like to visit and their ideal order to catch the best time for my plans (no rainy season, not too hot/cold, good time to see certain animals, cool events/festivities, etc.) I accounted for roughly one month per country, but the exact duration was tbd until I've done more research. 
 To get in close contact with locals, I would recommend to book homestays or a room in a family home though AirBnB. Those people are always super nice, open to foreigners, usually don't want to scam you and love to invite you to their dinner plans. Lovely people overall.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1po73rm/need_advice_about_extended_solo_travelling/
Reddit,Need advice about extended solo travelling,Potential_Teacher_77,"Hostels can be vastly different from one another these days do your research. There are plenty of “party” hostels with layouts that still allow for quiet in the dorms.  
 I second what everyone else says about getting either a private room in a hostel or a dorm room with the least number of beds in it. Call ahead and honestly steer clear of places that don’t have a lot of clear photos that’s usually hiding something. (Size, or quality of the dorms)  
 But as far as extended stays in a hostel they usually don’t mind that but some places have limits depending on the season. I would recommend calling the hostel to see if they could give you a discount on a long term stay, especially if it’s an off season from tourism in that city.  
 Just be aware that hostels have a ton of people coming and going if you stay in a dorm, you never know who might come next.  
 I highly recommend hostels overall bc a lot them offer discounts on excursions/activities. The social aspect is incredible. And don’t believe the stereotypes about hostels. People of all ages stay at hostels. It’s not uncommon to find 2-5 people that are 35+ at a hostel. Use Hostelworld and google reviews. Keep in mind people do leave comments out of anger not always truth. But if multiple people say the same thing it’s fact. 
 If you want to make friends you have to be direct. Ask someone to get a meal together or just strike up conversation. There’s no magic pill. Hostels/ solo travelers are usually very open to hanging out even if they are introverted. 
 When I was traveling full time 1-2 months was perfect for me. I would get into a routine enjoy the sites then start planning the next place. This is all personal preference and depends if you like city you’re in.  
 To not get bored always travel to places that have some version of your favorite things. Mine are beaches, good food (to my taste), and a culture of people being open to friendship. Yours might be access to order delivery, diverse population, and quality baked goods lol.

Reddit,Going to Dakar soon – what to see and do?,netllama,"That's a pretty good list of options. 
 Unless you've never done an African safari before, or you're  really  want to do one on this trip, the wildlife in Senegal isn't really the best for that sort of thing.  Not saying you can't have a nice experience, but there are many far better places in Africa for a safari. 
 The African Renaissance Monument is massive, although its rarely open to go inside.  Not saying its not worth swinging by to look at, but don't get your hopes up.  What's far more interesting is the same general area is the Mosque of the Divinity. 
 The western most point on continental Africa is also in Dakar, although its really difficult to access as its mostly surrounded by private property. 
 Doing a day to trip Saint-Louis is going to be an insane amount of driving (upwards of 10 hours round trip).  I don't think that's a good use of time.  Either you should spend the night up there, or save it for another time.  Saly is doable, but I'm puzzled why you'd want to go there.  Its a fairly ordinary small city. 
 There's no safety issues, and transportation is mostly the same as you find in lots of urban African cities.  There are also ""normal"" taxis, but they will definitely try to rip you off.  If you're going to be doing a ton of tourist activities in the region, you might want to contact your hotel to arrange a driver so you have a good experience, at a fixed price, without any surprises.",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1mwl9gg/going_to_dakar_soon_what_to_see_and_do/

 Personally I'd drop French Polynesia/Marquesas Islands and especially Hawaii and concentrate more on Indonesia/Malaysia and perhaps Papua New Guinea but that's just me. 
 Since you've already been to Mexico and Guatemala I'd cut back on the 10 weeks there and spend more time moving south through Central America then in Panama jumping on a sail boat charter through the San Blas Islands and onward to Colombia by that route. 
 I'd steal some time from your South American destinations and add Brazil. 
 Bottom line though, you've put together quite an itinerary and it's a fantastic guide/template to start your trip. That said, I think you should be prepared to throw much of your plan into the trash bin, haha.   
 The best thing  by far  about the privilege of having the time/money for a long trip is flexibility. 1.) There will be places you fall in love with and will want to stay longer... 2.) There will be places where the vibe just isn't happening and you'll want to move on immediately... 3.) And most importantly there will be places you've never even heard of that you'll learn about from locals and other travellers and you'll want to detour to check them out...

Reddit,Around the world trip - recommendations please!,Kananaskis_Country,"Here's a few additional thoughts... 
 1.)  Travelling long term is difficult. It's really, really difficult. It wears you down. It's only natural to eventually miss English, comfort food, a proper mattress, familiar supermarkets/stores, your long term relationships with family and friends, etc. The hundredth, ""so where are you headed"" conversation starter with other backpackers gets sooooo old. 
 What I do is simply stop travelling. 
 I find a place I really like and get some long term accommodation that's private. I get to know my neighbourhood really well. Become a regular at some favourite bars, restaurants, cafes, etc. Get to know the grocer and the lady at the fruit stand. Become a fan/groupie of a couple of local bands. Do art gallery openings. Get into the underground bar/music/art scene. Throw dinner parties for your new friends. Become a member of the community. Eventually you'll be recharged and itching to hit the road again.  
 2.)  Go home. There is NO shame in this, especially once you hit 3 or 4 months. Long term travel isn't for everyone and that's absolutely no big deal.

If your ex has expressed this wish, then he will likely proceed with it. 
 
 Everyone here has given great advice, but I think you should start by informing your daughter of this development. Also, tell her of all that could go wrong; girls in such marriages get trapped for a passport with no way out. She should be mentally prepared and know when to ask for help. 
 Put an apple tag in your daughter's personal stuff because phones can be taken away. 
 Get her a backup phone you can use for emergency calls and some cash on hand. 
 Make her memorize important 2-3 numbers, like the embassy and local police. 
 Ask your ex to book a return ticket, and show it to you. 
 You should share all those details with the NZ embassy. 
 Khanewal or Vehari are much smaller cities; no one will stand for her if your ex's family is influential. Lahore and Islamabad will offer her much more protection. Try to keep the itinerary confirmed. 
 Teach your daughter basic Urdu words for help, marriage, train, bus, and such. She should know how to ask for help and take care of her own, in case it takes you time to get to her.

 But plenty of options in Europe too: Greece is amazing (on Crete we recommend Eleonas Country Village with kids), and Spain is always good with kids. So child-friendly. We especially loved Villajoyosa: a charming town, beautiful beach and a great playground right on the beach. Book an Airbnb close to the beach and I reckon you’d have a great time. Mallorca is great too, many child-friendly resorts and plenty to do and see.  
 As for the flight: we split long flights up, by manually adding a multi-night layover. For example, for Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur (usually 12+ hours), we did Amsterdam-Abu Dhabi (6 hours), stayed there for 2 nights, then did Abu Dhabi-Kuala Lumpur (6,5 hours). This was way more manageable for all of us. We had 2 decent nights of sleep and we saw a new city, win-win! And the tickets were actually lots cheaper with this layover 🤷🏻‍♀️

 From Pereira Airport, I took the taxi to Terminal de Transporte (20mil), and then the bus to Salento (12.5mil). You can go to Filandia for 9mil one way, they leave on the hour at the town square.

 Medellin has their own transport card as well, think it was 8000ish pesos, and then whatever amount you want to add.

Reddit,Colombia - European Solo Female Travel,otterb76,"Few pieces of advice from my perspective:
- haven’t been to Bogota but from what I’ve heard, you could probably do just 3-4 days and that’ll be plenty 
- Salento: I loooooved Salento, but it is a super small town so I think 8 days would be a lot just in Salento. I did ~2.5, and probably could have done 1-2 more, but not more than that. However, there’s some neat towns in that little area just like 1 hr from Salento (Filadelfia, Manizales, Armenia) so you could probably spend 8 days across those few towns. As far as transportation from Salento to Medellin - I believe it’s a pretty long bus ride, so it’s a lot further than it looks on a map due to topography. A flight wouldn’t be too expensive, but if you’re on a budget a bus is fine. The country side is absolutely stunning, but I could definitely see travel by road getting a little hairy given the topography, rain, and windy/unpaved roads. 
- Medellin: awesome city, i would probably add 1-2 days here that you cut out from your bogota stay. There’s some cool day trips you can do from here. of course there’s Guatape but I also did a day tour to Jardin which I really liked  
 I was with my Colombian partner so we stayed in hotels and stuff, and the tours we did were in Spanish (Turibus). I was not really on a budget but you can get around for super cheap - easily on like $50 a day excl hostel. To get to Salento from pereira, a taxi was like 160k pesos ($40) but I’m sure there’s buses.  
 There was much less English speaking than I was expecting tbh, especially compared to somewhere like Mexico, so knowing some Spanish will certainly help. People are super super fun and friendly and you will have a great time. The dangers of Colombia are far exaggerated but I would still advise that you be cautious with your phone and things as petty theft certainly exists.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pvowjj/colombia_european_solo_female_travel/
Reddit,Colombia - European Solo Female Travel,otterb76,"In Salento you can hike the Cocora Valley (I did a horse ride but most people hike). You can get there from the town plaza of Salento, and they have Willy’s that take you there every 30 min or so. There’s also a lot of coffee farms nearby so you can walk to the farms (I wouldn’t really call it a “hike”, more of a trail) and those are a cool experience too. They also have some bird watching tours as well.  
 For Medellín, I would do a bus tour to get a feel and see the whole city. There’s some nice art museums (blanking on the names) and it has a better, more diverse food scene than the rest of Colombia. Doing the tour to Guatape (~1 hr outside the city) is also really beautiful. The cable cars are a cool experience. I couldn’t fit it in but a lot of people go to Comune 13, where Pablo Escobar grew up. It’s apparently a really cool area with lots of street art - you get a better feel for how the average person lives, as the wealthier people live in the Valley while the common folk live up on the hills. However, some people dislike the Comune 13 tours as it glorifies Pablo, so to each their own. Plaza Botero is also a cool spot in the heart of the city - Botero is a famous sculptor / artist. 
 As far as this other person’s comment about dangers of Colombia - as long as you’re smart, you will be fine. As a woman you’ll likely get cat called and objectified, but I wouldn’t consider that unique to Colombia in this flawed world we live in.

There he got drugged and captured by them and three other men. There was also a 14 year old boy involved in the illegal activity. The police got informed because they asked for money from his family and his family paid the money but also contacted the police.

 Be safe, wear proper safety gear esp windbreakers and helmets with relatively clean visor have side mirrors installed and make sure you have extra petrol in a bottle for emergencies and stash your belongings securely and carry only 500-1000 in pocket with id card copy!

Reddit,Do you give friendly places bad reviews?,ICThat,"I’m a Japanese hiker. It seems you stayed at a mountain hut (yamagoya) rather than a hotel. 
 Mountain huts come with service expectations that are completely different from ordinary hotels (before COVID, even private rooms were rare). 
 Because they operate in remote mountain locations with limited resources, mountain huts require various compromises. For example, staff might call guests over a loudspeaker when it’s time for dinner. Hikers understand this when they choose to stay there, so they don’t complain. Well, the smell in the toilets can be an issue—but that’s a problem caused by guests, not the hut. After all, having a bed to sleep in and a meal to eat in the middle of the mountains is something to be grateful for, isn’t it? 
 (Many mountain huts are located on ridgelines or near summits and don’t compete with hotels, but there are also huts at the base of mountains, usually operated by the same owners and have similar rules) 
 You go out of your way to stay at a mountain hut and then leave a review because it’s different from a hotel. You’re free to leave a negative review, and it might prevent future unhappy experiences. But please don’t try to force the hut to “improve” because of that.

Reddit,Do you give friendly places bad reviews?,uiemad,"A review should be two things: any and all information relevant to the business owner or prospective customers and an overall score that reflects your satisfaction/willingness to recommend.

However I was also displeased that I felt the menu was misleading with unclear prices and photos that were noticeably more generous than the actual product. 
 I started off my review with my overall assessment, a 4/5. I mentioned there were some negatives that were important but overall I was satisfied and would recommend it for anyone looking for Persian food. I then explained all the positives and negatives. 
 This is basically the minimum for a useful review. Everyone has different priorities and maybe for you, the staff being kind and accommodating is super important and heavily impacts the score.

Reddit,Sehat card for dialysis,OkFix126,"Long comment. 
 Go to a government hospital as early as you can, and I mean really early, around 5 or 6 in the morning. Ask for an emergency dialysis slot, you'll need a written reference from the doctor for that. Try to get the first few dialysis sessions done there so his condition stabilizes and he starts feeling a bit better. Once that’s done, ask your doctor to write down the names of all the hospitals in Lahore that provide dialysis. I would’ve guided you more directly, but I’m in Faisalabad. 
 After that, get in touch with the nephrologist at the hospital you decide on and coordinate ongoing dialysis there. In a private setup, the cost of one dialysis session is usually around 10k, including medicines. 
 Now, I don’t know what your financial situation looks like, but sustaining three dialysis sessions a week is honestly very difficult. So you basically have two options. 
 First, where does your dad work? Is he a private employee or a government one? If he worked for a private company, many of them have contracts with Social Security Hospital. You’ll need to confirm this with his workplace. If they do, get his employee card. From there, they’ll guide you to a center where you can get a health card. That card ensures free dialysis at Social Security Hospital Lahore. 
 The second route is to check if your dad’s primary care doctor also works at a government hospital. If he does, ask him to help you get a fixed dialysis time there. It usually takes time because there are hundreds of patients waiting, but having a doctor involved helps. 
 The Sehat Card used to work when my dad was on dialysis, I think this was when Imran Khan was still in government. In our case, it stopped after about a year. I don’t know what the situation is right now, but it’s still worth asking about. 
 All of this matters, but your immediate priority should be either getting emergency dialysis at a government hospital or speaking to your nephrologist. If you’ve been seeing him long enough, he’ll usually guide you to the right place. Mine even helped us get a proper slot and timings for the first few times. Also, get his number, that’s more important than you think. 
 One more thing: if you go the government hospital route, insist on a full 4 hour dialysis session. They’ll often try to shorten it to 2 hours to accommodate more patients. Don’t agree to that unless there’s absolutely no option. Push for at least 3 hours ideally 4. It makes a real difference. 
 Lastly, I know this is terrifying, and right now you probably don’t even know what to do or where to start. It’s a long journey, and there will be problems at every step. Over time, you’ll end up learning how to manage his symptoms and everything that comes with this, you'll have to become his own Doctor. Don't forget to take care of yourself in all that. 
 May Allah guide you through it and make it easier. And if you ever need help, or just someone to talk to who’s already been through this, feel free to reach out.",10,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1pr6ojc/sehat_card_for_dialysis/

 I just completed the 1st leg of a 14ish hour drive from Kuwait & decided to stay overnight here. 
 Iraq has been voted as the Arab Touristic country of 2025 and I've seen plenty of tourists on my way up here. 
 As for security, I picked up a hitchhiker at a checkpoint & we spent the last 200km trip having some pretty interesting discussions! Tourism is up, life is still hard for the regular citizen, but the country's security has improved since my last visit last year. 
 Everyone I interacted with wanted to invite me for tea, into their homes or just stick around like this guy and wander around Mosul at night proudly showing me the sights.  
 He got pretty upset when I declined his invitation to stay the night at his house and his mother wanted to snitch to MY mother for being stubborn lol

 China: Qingdao isn’t a must-see unless you have a specific reason; you could skip it to add more time in Beijing or Shanghai.

Reddit,3.5 Month Asia Trip Itinerary,Rozii7,"Honestly it’s a solid itinerary, the only thing I’d change is to add more days in Thailand. Not into the islands? 
I’ve spent more than a few months in Thailand, visited 6 times and still haven’t seen everything. 
 Vietnam is amazing, but you could consider shifting a few days there to Thailand if you want. Though better to shift from others. 
Since you’re travelling in February, do watch out for Tet, many places close for the holiday, so visas, museums, and some cultural sites may be unavailable for days. 
There are other Asian festivals to be aware of too, like Songkran in Thailand and Vietnam. You can plan around.
I tend to spend Lunar New Year in Chiang Mai and find it really pleasant. 
 It’s great that you have a rough plan of where and when, but if you’re flexible, feel free to tweak things once you’re there, that’s one of the best parts of travel. Transport between these countries is straightforward. 
 I did most of Vietnam by train, usually first class. The Thai trains are generally nicer, and for some odd reason many night trains in Vietnam arrives around 4am, but they were serviceable. 
 For Angkor Wat, definitely get the 3-day pass, the site is enormous and you’ll likely be up at 3 am one of those days if you want the classic sunrise shot. 
 For Pai, get motion sickness pills in Thailand. Don’t try to get this before your trip, it’s so much cheaper there. Going from Chiang Mai to Pai will be rough. You can get the yellow pills or ask about the blue pills, pharmacist would know that it may be better for that journey. Take it during the journey. You’ll understand why when you check the road on maps.
I generally use train from BKK to Chiang Mai but it’s a long journey. You will be losing days travelling around in Thailand. 
 I have esim from Thailand that I just top up when I visit for data, I recommend AIS. 
 Not sure why you go to Cambodia from Singapore but if you do happen to travel by land from Thailand to Cambodia, beware of the scammers. 
Ibis bus service was very good and safe to use in between and they take care of visa needs for a very small fee.  
 I could probably recommend tons of places and things to do, but it would take me hours to type it all. I’ll try to come back to this post later with more suggestions :)

Reddit,3.5 Month Asia Trip Itinerary,Rozii7,"Ah, it depends, almost everywhere in Thailand is touristy to some degree. But if you walk or ride a bit further out, you’ll find beaches where you can be completely alone. 
 Koh Phangan is one of the most popular islands for full moon parties. I usually go right after the parties end, and it’s not too hard to find tranquility once the crowds leave. You just have to time it right. 
 Islands like Phi Phi and Ko Samui are always busy, but you can easily find beautiful, quieter ones like Koh Lanta, Koh Yao Noi, Koh Chang or Koh Kood. Krabi is a great base to visit most of them. 
Railay is touristy, but I still like it :) 
 If you’re a city person, you’ll probably enjoy Singapore and Malaysia. 
If you’re flying through Singapore, add a few hours just to explore the airport btw. It has a butterfly garden, a great waterfall and a cinema inside all free to enjoy.
Penang/Georgetown in Malaysia has great museums like Upside Down, Dark Mansion and Tech Dome, all worth to see. 
 I personally prefer jungles and forests, if you drive a bit further beyond Chiang Mai in Thailand, there are some amazing green areas and villages. Do you like Jazz? Some good jazz bars around there too. 
 Pai is a little hippy town, lots of high or drunk backpackers partying there too, but once you find your crowd, it’s amazing.  
 You’re very welcome! 
 Edit: IMO, the last part of your itinerary could be saved for another trip, and you could shift those days to the first few countries you visit. You’ll definitely want some rest days in between with the number of countries you’ve planned, it seems a bit overwhelming. I’d personally limit it to 4–5 countries max.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1o0foot/35_month_asia_trip_itinerary/
Reddit,3.5 Month Asia Trip Itinerary,trainerkittyk,"I think you should plan the itinerary so you have at least half a day to a full day to relax, sleep in, do laundry, watch a movie - be still for a few hours, sit at a cafe and enjoy the view, each week.. get into a routine so you dont get tired from the constant commute and all the sightseeing and have energy to last for the whole trip.  
 The sun, heat and humidity in South East Asian countries is really draining... drink lots of water. Bring lots of medication to help deal with food related issues.. 
 3.5 months of travelling is a long time. Have you travelled overseas for 4 weeks - 6 weeks before?  
 The number of nights per stop depends on what you want to see and do. If you can tell us what you plan to see /do in these cities, people can try to give you more info or advice with timeframes per stop or to skip a specific attraction. 
 For example, I would prefer to stay in Da Nang as a base and do day trips to Hue and Hoi An. From Da Nang you fly to Hanoi. BUT when I was in Vietnam, for 6 weeks earlier this year, and I spent 3 nights in Hue, 5 nights in Hoi An then 3 nights in Da Nang.  I wished I had another day in Hue.. again depends on your interests  
 We all have different travel styles but I would rather leave Malaysia and Singapore for another trip with the Phillippines, Indonesia, Borneo, PNG etc. With those extra 12 days, spend it in Thailand, China and India or Pakistan - pick one.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1o0foot/35_month_asia_trip_itinerary/

Reddit,First time solo traveling. I am looking for safe & budget-friendly destinations,The_Pinga_Man,"That depends on what budget friendly means to you.  
 I will recommend you Rio de Janeiro, but that might depend a bit of the budget. Traveling to Rio, you will stay in the nice areas, and it's not nearly as violent as media portraits it (as long as you don't join a drug gang). It has beaches, parties, trekking, and so on, and on a dollar budget everything ends up being cheap.  
 Out of that, my recommendation is to stay in hostels, not Airbnb. Wherever you end up going, in hostels you will find a bunch of other travelers, a bunch of them traveling alone. It's quite easy to find your ""best friend for the next week"".  
 Do check hostelworld.com reviews, people do leave reviews saying if it's a good hostel for people traveling alone. Beware of hotels trying to disguise them as hostels (they suck).  
 The problem with Airbnb and hotels is that you won't meet many people. Hostels are made so that you do meet other people. For me that's the best thing about traveling anywhere.

 i love hiking, so hiking trails/mountains are the first thing i check out when thinking of visiting a country. if you start from a place of what interests you, it's easier to filter out the information overload. 
 anyway, lonely planet is a great resource to see what are considered the must-visit destinations for each country :)",12,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ptqml9/how_do_you_research_a_country_before_exploring_it/
Reddit,How do you research a country before exploring it for the first time? (Backpacking),Hot_Combination2596,"Same. I have a process.  
 I created a Google Sheets. Then, I search name of country I’m going to + duration of trip + itinerary + modifier if applicable(for example wanted to do an off-roading road trip in Oman). 
 I ope everything that’s returned on the first page. Quick skim of the article and blogger’s bio to see if they align with my travel style.  
 Those that make the cut, I add everything each recommends to the google spreadsheet and start a counter at 1. Everytime a location is brought up/recommended again, the counter goes up by one. 
 Once that’s done, I sort the sheet by number of recommendations from highest to lowest. I then divide the list into thirds. Top third is must see, second third is supporting stop/filler, third is if I have time. 
 The. I create a custom google map of the destination. Assign a different color to each category and plot all of the destinations on the map. 
 I the. plan my route/stops based on efficiency/colocation. If a must see is particularly out of the way, will fiddle with the itinerary to see how to work it in but sometimes it’s just not possible.  
 I download my map and reference it while there. Don’t have an hour by hour itinerary but if I’m in a city for three days, I check the map, see what I have saved and plan the day based on what I’m in the mood for. Usually a must see stop with maybe a few supporting/filler spot that are nearby or on the way. 
 I work as a data professional if the process didn’t make that obvious and this is honestly one of my favorite parts of planning a trip. 
 Also, we like to watch YouTube videos but that’s more to hype us up. We love a good Rick Steve if it exists but we tend to travel to non-European destinations so not always an options. 
 Edit to add: google has a highlights/landmarks/scenic viewpoint feature now(shows up in purple text on the map). I’ve found some wonderful sights that way as well.",5,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ptqml9/how_do_you_research_a_country_before_exploring_it/

 Sometimes I'll supplement that with old school guidebooks or old posts from others in this subreddit and other travel subreddits. If it's a country with relatively little tourist traffic, sometimes specific blogs about that country can be helpful for supplemental information or for more details. 
 I'll compile this research into notes, listed roughly in order of interest, and will then partially ""wing it"" when on the trip itself, trying to leave some space open for me to extend a stay in a specific area if I really like it there, or leave a place early if desired, etc",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ptqml9/how_do_you_research_a_country_before_exploring_it/

Reddit,How do you research a country before exploring it for the first time? (Backpacking),Normal-Raisin5443,"I go on Google Street view. Just check out a few streets to get a vibe of the place. If It looks good, I’ll search for images of that town around social media. 
 I’ve always tried to learn about different countries since I was a kid. I have a bit if background already on different countries. It’s rewarding because if I’m in my own city and I meet someone from another country, I can ask them for more information about something they’re proud of about their country or literature. I love how this connection brightens people up. I’ve had so many great conversations because of this.  
 My learning is from talking to people from that country and asking them to tell me about it, reading their classical literature, watching their movies, searching for recipes, dining at their restaurants in whatever city I currently live in, browsing social media accounts, reading travel books and watching YouTube travel videos. I’ll also sometimes play some of their music by searching for folk music or musicians..  
 Before I plan a trip somewhere, I decide on weather (tropical, desert, winter, forest, big cities or culture/architecture/food) Then, I just check out the current vibes on street view or image search before going. 
 I’ll also search for topics I’d like to explore and add those sites to my itinerary. It’s a good way to make the trip mine as opposed to visiting only tourist sites. For example, when I went to NYC, I didn’t go see the Statue of Liberty. I stumbled on a quiet park and had a grocery store picnic on the bench at a river looking at it from far away. 100% of that vacation was entirely my own. I mainly stuck to a theme for what I wanted to explore while in NYC so those places were added to my itinerary. It was such a good vacation!

Reddit,How do you research a country before exploring it for the first time? (Backpacking),HMWmsn,"I always start with the city/region/country official tourism websites. Those are treasure troves of information that go beyond the ""big ticket things.""  Good ones also have events calendars, information on tours/day trips, and suggested itineraries that include variety of days and interests.  And this is where you can often find those ""hidden gems"" that people want (but are hesitant to try because they don't have enough ""likes""). 
 A few years ago I was thinking about adding a couple of days in Tallinn to a trip. After looking at the Tallin and Estonia websites, I completely chucked my initial plan and spent the whole time in Estonia - and have more to see.   
 I've also started looking at some Instagram posts for a trip I'm planning to Scotland - it's helpful, but I'm aware that some posts can be paid influencers, which will have bias.

Reddit,Travel plan adjustment?,Kananaskis_Country,"1.) What's your daily travel budget, not including flights? 
 2.) If you stay out of the Tier 1 and 2 cities then China is very affordable. 
 3.) What time of year? Google, ""burning season in SE Asia."" 
 4.) It's great that you've done this research and prep. So many first timers come to travel forums and expect everyone to turn in their private Travel Agent and plan everything for them. Kudos to you.   
 You've obviously put a lot of thought into this and your options are a fantastic guide/template to start your trip. That said, I think you should be prepared to throw much of your plan into the trash bin.   
 The best thing  by far  about the privilege of having the time/money for a long trip is flexibility. 1.) There will be places you fall in love with and will want to stay longer... 2.) There will be places where the vibe just isn't happening and you'll want to move on immediately... 3.) And most importantly there will be places you've never even heard of that you'll learn about from locals and other travellers and you'll want to detour to check them out...   
 Bottom line:  Make use of this wonderful opportunity and be open to spontaneity. In other words you don't have to worry about this right now. China can happen - or not - while you're travelling.

Reddit,Travel plan adjustment?,Kananaskis_Country,"Any advice you'd have on how to avoid feeling burnt out? 
 
 1.)  Travelling long term is difficult. It's really, really difficult. It wears you down. It's only natural to eventually miss English, comfort food, a proper mattress, familiar supermarkets/stores, your long term relationships with family and friends, etc. The hundredth, ""so where are you headed"" conversation starter at the hostel bar gets sooooo old. 
 What I do is simply stop travelling. 
 I find a place I really like and get some long term accommodation that's private. I get to know my neighbourhood really well. Become a regular at some favourite bars, restaurants, cafes, etc. Get to know the grocer and the lady at the fruit stand. Become a fan/groupie of a couple of local bands. Do art gallery openings. Get into the underground bar/music/art scene. Throw dinner parties for your new friends. Become a member of the community. Eventually you'll be recharged and itching to hit the road again.  
 2.)  Go home. There is NO shame in this, especially once you hit 3 or 4 months. Long term travel isn't for everyone and that's absolutely no big deal. 
 Hope you find something that works for you.

Of course it depends on what you do and how you want to travel but id say you can get by on less than 30$ a day, or at least I did.

Reddit,Travel plan adjustment?,No-Grocery-1453,"You definitely won’t need a full month in Cambodia, and I think 2-3 weeks in Laos is plenty as it’s a very small country with not a ton to do. Japan looks really expensive from the outside, especially when looking at accom but it’s actually super inexpensive when you’re there (depending on what you’re doing). The food is cheap, the trains are cheap and super accessible, and a lot of attractions are sooo inexpensive, if not free. Would probably the same as China if not cheaper, just basing that off what I hear from people that have been to China. Japan was one of my favourite countries and you could definitely fill up your days with 2 months there! Just keep in mind what months you’d be going. 2 months in Vietnam and Thailand is 👌. If you want to stay in SEA, you should go to the Philippines, especially siargao island. But the great thing about SEA is that it’s so plug and play.

Yes it's pricier, but after 4 months of budget travel you'll probably appreciate having more infrastructure and variety. Plus 2 months is enough time to do it properly without rushing - Yunnan, Sichuan, the cities, some nature.    
 If budget's tight, consider Option C with Taiwan instead. Way more affordable than Japan, incredible food scene, easy to navigate, and still feels like a distinct final chapter after SE Asia. You could do 1.5 months Taiwan + 2 weeks back in Thailand to decompress before flying home. One thing - for a 6 month trip make sure you get solid travel insurance that covers the whole region. Something like LUMA works across all those countries. Medical stuff adds up fast in China especially.

 Have trust in Allah. When He takes something precious from us, He helps us in ways we cannot even imagine. I have experienced this myself.

 I also lost my father on Dec 13, 2024. I'm 23M, a freelance video editor, doing it for 3 years. 
 My father was old, so I decided to skip the University and tried doing coding, but Corona ruined that plan, then I started working on my Freelancing, Graphic designing, and video editing skills. Now I will learn Unreal Engine. 
 I got my first video editing order on Dec 27, 2022, on Fiverr.  
 And got my first graphic design-related order on Jan 01, 2023.  
 After these 2 orders, my life changed. I keep getting orders hired by an ad agency, and my life gets set. felt like Allah making ways for me. 
 Then, on Dec 13, my father passed away. It impacted me mentally, not financially. Time passed very quickly. 
 So my advice for you is to do short/long courses or a diploma.
My cousin, my brother, and I did them in different fields, and now earning over 50K+. 
 Avoid university because you don't have 4 years to waste just to end up questioning yourself about what you will do next after completing Uni. Uni is not bad if you study something that is in demand, especially in Pakistan. My female friend just completed her Uni and her starting package is 50K, but she's a chemist, which I think is in demand. 
 Do a job at a call center till you get a proper job after doing a diploma or courses, and make sure the call center does legit business so you and your family will eat halal. 
 Sari Zindaghi call center pr na guzar dena bhai. Srif Zindaghi ki gadri ko dhakka deny ky liye kafi hai. 
 I don't know if my advice is good for you or not, but hard work will make anything work. Allah pr bahrosa rakhon sab thik hojayga. Don't rush.  
 FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS AND GET READY FOR A CRAZY LONG JOURNEY. SHOW THE WORLD WHAT YOU ARE MADE OF. MAKE YOUR FATHER AND FAMILY PROUD OF YOU. ENTER IN YOUR WINTER ARC. BE STRONGER BE BRAVE YOUR FAMILY NEEDS YOU. LOOK INSIDE YOU AND GRAB THAT HARD WORKING DEMON THAT IS SLEEPING INSIDE YOU.

Reddit,My dad passed away 4 days before my 18th birthday. I don't know how to move forward.,CreativeContourss,"Inna Lillahi Wainna ilaihe rajeon. I pray Allah Almighty grant him jannat ul firdous and sabr e jameel to all your family. Not that I lost my father at your age but I did at 23. I will say you dont have to overburden yourself. Yes you are the eldest boy of the house now but it's important that you keep yourself open to talk specially with your mother and siblings(depending upon how sensible and emotionally strong they are). Often frustration builds from time to time but if you have a sane environment built on mutual ""Ahsaas"" for everyone, you all will be able to take things smoothly. Here's my take on your questions 
 
 Get his death certificate issued. Keep the important documents with yourself(or your mother or just somewhere safe) like his CNIC, property documents, vehicle documents, etc. Follow the process to get things inherited after consulting with your family(incase you all feel it's the right time) 
 When you lose someone this close it leaves a hole in you. Doesn't mean the hole will fill with time but you will definitely get used to live with it. You might not even realize that how quickly first few months or years will pass by and eventually you will come to terms with it. Best thing to do rn instead of only putting social media posts or stories is to do good deeds and make a habit of reciting Surah  Al-Mulk. This way you can actually do something for him.  
 That totally varies from household to household. Incase your family was already living paycheck to paycheck then little brother things become a bit weird because someone needs to step up and start earning something close. People might assist you initially too but can't expect them to assist you forever. Sooner you turn towards becoming financially independent, the better it is. In today's world my recommendation will be to find a mentor/office anything, tell them about your circumstances unfiltered and ask them to teach you a skill. Skill is a big commodity in today's world. Once equipped starting offering your services online to get paid is dollars. This way you can jumpstart your career, support your family and have chance of good growth. 
 I think 3rd point gives a pathway in my opinion. You can also claim scholarships like Ehsaas or by whatever name it goes by now. Maybe universities you apply too will also consider your case. Usually they require documents like electricity bills, house pictures, etc.  
 
 Lastly don't be too hard or too soft on yourself. Speak when it hurts to your loved ones and friends(only those who can keep things to themselves and preferably 1 or atmost 2). Dont let yourself become a pressure cooker and dont think you can't do anything. And as it is said ""Dua momin ka hathiar ha"" be punctual in prayers. Even try to pray tahajjud; for yourself, your father, your family and the whole ummah. Make duas in sujoods. InshaAllah everything will be fine❤️🫂",13,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1prdvf8/my_dad_passed_away_4_days_before_my_18th_birthday/
Reddit,My dad passed away 4 days before my 18th birthday. I don't know how to move forward.,warlok1,"What is the best way to handle the legal/official things that come with being 18 and losing a parent?  
 
 you need to make a succession certificate so your dads bank account can be liquidated and assets transferred in your name (property car bike etc). If there are assetts in conflict, you might want to give the option of figuring those out with your relatives because they might give you a grace period of feeling sorry for you and look to resolve. 
 
 How do you keep going when the grief feels this heavy? 
 
 find employment. it distracts you from grief. morning work night job minimum time at home or leaisure.  
 
 How do you manage your financial situation as the oldest son? 
 
 i lost my dad at 16. i started working at his business which didnt work out hten i worked in call centers. All praise to Allah the ar razzaq, al mughni, al mukeet, al qayuum who gave me more than i deserve. Rizq comes from places you never expect. and if your situation doesnt improve. never be ungrateful.

If you're just coming into it and have a surface level understanding of these ideas you won't get it.  
 The proof is in the pudding, all the people who push this messaging are all progressives/liberals, literally no conservative does this EVER. They essentially 'support' India in antagonism to Pakistan (they disagree with Pakistan being a religious state, India, at least on paper is secular, so they support that). They decouple the culture from the religion, make these yuppie hipster arguments about love, aman blah blah, and they close their eyes to legitimate historical reasons for the creation of Pakistan. Their reading of history puts Pakistan as doing all the wrongs, having no history, having an 'identity crisis', and no culture, while India did nothing wrong, and is an aNcIeNt ciViLizAtiOn. This is just one example. 
 In doing so, they subtly are soft on India, they prefer not to and ACTIVELY avoid calling out India/Hindus, because they don't want to 'accidentally' legitimize or back the Pakistani (according to them 'right wing') narrative of the two nation theory, that we can never coexist with Indians. Muzammil Shah was literally kvetching about this in his videos about this conflict, it was so funny to see. He was moaning and crying that he can no longer make a legitimate argument against the 'right wingers' over here lol. He seemed to be more upset at India for strengthening the right wing here than launching missiles at us. I hope you understand it now.

 1) Using AI for artwork is kind of inevitable now isn't it.  
 2) Also, we did start the Kargil misadventure where we branded actual military personnel as freedom fighters who are not affiliated with the army which is why we didn't even accept martyrs bodies nor the shaheed like Capt Colonel Sher Khan who fought brilliantly in the war, completely unaided. 
 This misadventure started just months after their PM Vajpayee visited Lahore and negotiations on Kashmir started. Similar tactics were employed (Mumbai attacks) after talks between Pakistan and India, as well as before the 2016 SAARC conference. There is a pattern here where whenever Pakistan and India establish any talks for greater economic cooperation which suits interests for both sides, some militants attack right across the border in Kashmir, leading to suspicion and halting of any talks. 
 I don't know why this is even unpopular here since most of this is well known by all.

Reddit,Want to hear from people who actually like living in pakistan,YoGoYagashi,"I’ve never lived in Pakistan, born and brought up US diaspora. I feel it’s assumed by Pakistanis looking to move abroad (esp from what I’ve read from this sub) that we become assimilated here, we should have no interest or anything to do with our cultural heritage at some point. I can understand people burned out and disappointed by a country like Pakistan, but in my experience, when you live in America long enough, you see the cracks of highly capitalist and consumerist society a bit more and appreciate the good parts of your cultural heritage. For one, assimilation in US is seen as a “good thing” by people outside the country, but it comes with a high expectation you be like the dominant culture here (which is mostly white) that comes with a lot of pressure and self-hatred I’ve seen amongst desis and other diaspora my age. I think Canada has a better model of integration and awareness of other cultures. Second, the work opportunities here are constantly evolving at a pace that’s becoming challenging for us younger folk - back in my parents generation, teaching, nursing or working at a store as income was enough to purchase a house. When I went to school for a healthcare degree, people acted like I was “settled” now, not realizing my field in this economy has a job market saturation that led me to do another masters after my doctorate. My generation is more educated yet the job opportunities & wealth accumulation opportunities are harder to obtain than they were in the past. The biggest allure of america is the job opportunities here, so when that’s not there, it’s harder to enjoy things here really. The individualistic society imo is lonely, the suburban sprawl makes it hard to go outside & find a place to be social and easier to stay at home and rarely leave your house. I am not saying America doesn’t still have opportunities and we are privileged being here, neither would I discourage anybody who wants to move here, but it’s not all sunshine and rainbows like the narrative I hear. I know Pakistan isn’t doing well currently , but if there were some improvements in the future, I wouldn’t mind living there for some years or a different country abroad for a while.",13,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ptvq5n/want_to_hear_from_people_who_actually_like_living/

 So it's a combination of the system as well as the toxic culture.  There are things I like about this place but my self respect won't allow me to pay taxes and get no rights in return, it just feels like I'm seen only as an ATM and not a fellow Muslim worthy of having safety (can't own a gun) or mobility (can't get a driver's license, and international licenses are only good for a year).  I've tried hard to make this place work but realistically I will probably go insane eventually living here. 
 For citizens I can also see why they want to leave.  I see how much my wife's family works for peanuts and then a huge chunk of that is taken at the end of the month to fund lavish lifestyles of bureaucrats and politicians.  I think they feel like they aren't valued as a person either.  The taxes are as high as Sweden but with none of the benefits (unless you're super rich and well connected).",5,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ptvq5n/want_to_hear_from_people_who_actually_like_living/

If I go abroad, it would be solely for career growth (not exactly financially but related, just getting to work on more challenging problems with smarter people in big tech to become more valuable in my career) and perhaps a better passport that just makes traveling easier (just a nice-to-have). 
 If I get married, I could never raise a daughter in this country. What a world it would be for a girl where she can't even go for a walk without feeling unsafe. I think it would be injustice to her. 
 Family is also a big reason to stay. I have a chronically sick parent and being able to take care of them gives me peace. I am not a religious person but caring for them gives my life some meaning. 
 Also if you are religious, it's probably way easier to find like-minded people since it's a conservative society, so that I can understand.  
 I will make a classist statement but I think in a poor 3rd world country you will find in public places, because of illiteracy, people are not well-mannered, and because of thinking about survival financially, people do not have hobbies, and consequently, less opportunities for you to go enjoy yourself. Once you go abroad, this does feel like a dealbreaker to be honest. But, it is what it is, we are a poor country and we have to help ourselves to improve our conditions. Running away is not a solution, it's an escape.

 Religion wise I am also content in keeping up the struggle. You know the comfortable you are the worst you are in Islamic performance. Working to improve your country is a good way towards a better Akhrat. Its a lower form of Jihad. 
 I am a firm believer to struggle till Pakistan remains Islamic. There is also the problem that it is not recommended to move to non-Islamic countries permanently. Even temporary stay is extremely regulated so why go into that, temptation is too dangerous. Islam doesn't cater to needs of comfort or financial stability when choosing another country to move to. 
 There are many toxic people in Pakistan and they hate it if you like living here. They don't respect freedom of expression if it goes against their opinions and actively try to suppress such dissent. They can't fathom another perspective, ignore them.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1ptvq5n/want_to_hear_from_people_who_actually_like_living/

Reddit,Solotravel in Oman without rented car,WalkingEars,"I traveled there for ~2.5 weeks without a car! It made some things a little more cumbersome or they require booking a guide, but it's still doable.  
 Within Muscat and Nizwa, there is an app called OTaxi that's similar to Uber. When I was there, the app didn't accept foreign credit cards, but you could still use it to book a driver at a flat price and then pay the driver with cash. 
 There's a bus company called Mwasalat that operates bus routes linking some of the major destinations. Booking tickets on their website didn't work for me, but I could still use the website to find timetables and then buy tickets either on board the bus or at the bus ""station"" when there was one. Some of these buses don't run very often but otherwise they weren't bad. 
 I used a guide for the Jebel Shams balcony hike and a Jebel Akhdar tour.  
 And if you're really stuck trying to get somewhere local-ish, you can ask someone working at the front desk of the hotel, and they likely can make a phone call and book you a cab for (in my experience) a reasonable price. 
 Yes you can haggle buying stuff there.

 In hindsight for Jebel Shams a guide wasn’t really needed, because the trail is easy to navigate for the most part (though perhaps a little scary if you have a hard time with heights).

Reddit,Any tips or information for a first time traveler doing a solo trip?,ApfelFarFromTree,"First of all, know that turbulence is a VERY normal part of flying and airplanes are literally built to be successful through turbulence. You will 100% hit turbulence when going to Miami due to the warm air over the Everglades - don’t panic, just expect it and tell yourself airplanes are purpose designed around it.  
 Other little tips - get a flight where you land in Miami during the day so you aren’t disoriented. Try to land around the time of your hotel check-in (4pm). If you are getting flustered trying to figure out how to leave the airport upon landing, always follow signs to Baggage Claim, even if you only carried on your bag. The exit doors for airports are always by Baggage Claim. Bring at least 2 credit cards and some cash. Know that Miami is expensive so look at menu and cocktail prices ahead of time to budget for the trip.   
 Are there hostels in Miami? If so, stay there and meet some other solo travelers. My first solo trip was overseas and I consistently met so many great travelers in hostels.  
 Lastly, be aware of who you talk to and what information about yourself you share. You want to act like you’re going to meet up with a friend, or your boyfriend is back at the hotel, etc etc.",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvr1ru/any_tips_or_information_for_a_first_time_traveler/

At home on a motorway the same distance would take me a little over 2 hours on a bus. Tanzania has thousands of cargo and oil trucks that are 40+ years old and they struggle to do more than 50kph meaning they slow all traffic down to their speed.

People are the nicest, if you step out alone too you wouldnt have any problem.

Reddit,"American traveling to Lahore, Pakistan for a wedding – what should I know?",Necessary_Low_6669,"I'm an overseas Pakistani who visited Lahore recently for the first time in 30 years with my spouse who is not of Pakistani or South Asian heritage. I wrote about my trip in detail here, which you can read here. To answer your questions, I would strongly encourage you to go but I would also strongly encourage you to be extremely careful, especially if you haven't traveled to a big city in a developing country like Cairo, Nairobi, or Mumbai. 
 Lahore is a heart-achingly beautiful place with a lot of history and a lot of culture. Not many people get to see this and Pakistanis know this. There's a strong culture of hospitality, but even a stronger desire to break the isolation the country has been experiencing over the last 20 years that's been easing recently. Most people will fall over themselves to be good hosts. 
 If both you and your wife are not Pakistani origin nor of South Asian heritage, you'll probably not want to be outside of your hotel without a local. Plenty of people do visit Lahore on their own, but I imagine that they're quite well-traveled in other places. 
 Ultimately, it's safe, but things can turn on a dime. For example, I was in Lahore for a week and on the last day, there were massive protests that led to a lot of major roads in the city being closed with a massive security presence. Major tourist sites, hotels and even shopping malls have metal detectors and armed guards checking cars for bomb, so in that sense I wouldn't worry about going to major tourist sites, but I would also have a mindset that prioritizes safety. 
 In terms of accommodations, you'll want to stay in a five-star hotel with its own security perimeter if you want to feel safe. This is a relatively short list: Pearl Continental, Avari, Nishat and maybe a few others. Assuming you and your wife don't have any family in Lahore, your wife's friend might offer you a place to stay. I'll let you decide how comfortable you feel doing that, but personally I'd stay in a place like the Pearl Continental, which is where international cricket teams stay in Lahore. 
 You realistically can't go anywhere in Lahore by yourself due to the amount of chaos on the streets. I felt like 500 metres was the furthest I could walk, even in the nicest parts of town. There are very few crosswalks or traffic lights in Lahore. You will absolutely need to have a car and driver take you anywhere. Uber doesn't work in Pakistan anymore, there are a few rideshare apps. 
 In terms of health, drinking only bottled water goes without saying, but if you eat at the nicest restaurants in the city, you should be fine. We didn't have any issues eating at high-end places in Gulberg, DHA, five-star hotels and malls like Emporium or Packages Mall. Air quality shouldn't be as bad in April, but it's an issue year-round in Lahore. I would also bear in mind that it would be extremely hot, as April and May are the hottest parts of the year, hot enough that sometimes birds fall out of the sky.",3,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1oymw8y/american_traveling_to_lahore_pakistan_for_a/

I liked Jakarta but it is incredibly chaotic and won't give you the best impression of Indonesia. 
 But... given your itinerary, I'd just stay in Malaysia. You also don't have to pay for a visa for only four days. 
 Also, one week is probably only enough to visit KL and Georgetown/Penang (Georgetown is in Penang).  
 Actually, here's what I'd do:
Fly UK to KL
- 4 days: KL (if you can't find enough to do for four days you can do a day trip to Melaka but there's plenty to do in KL anyway)
- 10 days: Borneo
- 2/3 days (optional): Ipoh but fly in to Penang and get the train/bus to Ipoh
- 4/5 days or 7 days: Georgetown, Penang
Fly Penang to UK 
 I did love the Cameron Highlands but it's a bit longer to get to. It's best as a few days stop between Ipoh and KL.

 For fancy clothes, look up Ellena (but it's only suitable when they're offering a discount). There's also Shaposh; which often has sales and is reasonable w.r.t formal clothing. 
 If you want to avoid brands altogether, you can visit Link Road market. Instead of exploring the brands on the ground/road floor, visit the basement stores; they're pretty reasonably priced w.r.t women's and  baby clothing. 100k is more than enough w.r.t.

Reddit,Trip Report - Oman,BraviaryScout,"Lovely trip report man. I've always wanted to visit Oman. Though I've heard it's more of a low profile destination as both the government and people might be welcome to visitors, they don't want them coming en masse akin to the crazy influx places like Portugal, Japan & Vietnam are having recently. 
 So while it's mostly car dependent, did you have an issue finding places to park? Also what did lodging options look like? 
 If I go, it'd probably be in the winter months. Few years ago, I went to Dubai for a few days in late June and I was  not  ready for that kind of scorching heat.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1k59bp5/trip_report_oman/
Reddit,Trip Report - Oman,SantaClausDid911,"Glad you enjoyed, friend! 
 
 both the government and people might be welcome to visitors, they don't want them coming en masse 
 
 I think yes and no. They do really well about allowing modernization while maintaining authenticity, and it's a very cool dichotomy. At the same time, I think they do a lot specifically to promote tourism, between relaxed laws for non-Muslims/tourists/expats, new developments, and really easy visas for lots of the world.  
 I'm sure there's an element of not wanting to lose that authenticity all the same, and then also just the natural course of ""it's not there yet"" with transportation, expanded flight routes, etc.  
 Not to mention the Middle East stigma. Dubai marketed hard to make itself an international destination, but outside of that, how much of the Middle East doesn't strike the average American (and some Europeans) as ""one of those desert Muslim countries"".  
 My guess is it's a destination that explodes within 10-15 years, and regardless, now is a really cool time to visit the country.  
 
 So while it's mostly car dependent, did you have an issue finding places to park? 
 
 Not really, parking is free and available just about everywhere. The only place you'll have trouble is around Mutrah if you're not staying around there, and even then, you can usually find something easily if you're down to walk a bit and you're not balls deep in 1 of 3 rush hours for the day lol.  
 
 If I go, it'd probably be in the winter months. Few years ago, I went to Dubai for a few days in late June and I was  not  ready for that kind of scorching heat. 
 
 I got back this weekend, and it's the latest I think anyone should go as April is the beginning of summer. Any later would have been miserable. Worth noting though, I'm pretty sure this is the ideal time of year for Salalah in the south, where it's lush and much cooler in monsoon season.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1k59bp5/trip_report_oman/

Reddit,Best watches store(online preferred),Donquicksoat,"You have two options - 
 1) Scour instagram for online sellers. I can point you in the direction of a few pages I've bought from, but I can't vouch for those I havent. Thriftwatches is good, bought my Hamilton from them and its been great.  
 2) Order from AliExpress. No joke, some of those brands aren't scams, but they are definitely knockoffs of famous designs. Pagani Design is pretty well known in this space, but I'm not overly familiar with the clone market in general. 
 To be clear, 10k is a small budget for a watch and already a pretty large compromise on reputable brand, a high quality case and bracelet, even more so if you want to go for an automatic movement. You would be best served with a Casio F91W or the like (you can get the silver model and swap the strap for an aftermarket bracelet if you're dead set on it looking like steel). You can probably get a pretty decent Seiko for about 20k, but the bracelets on their budget models are notoriously bad. Pick your poison.  
 Buying a watch at retail from a store has the downside of haggling, as you said, but you're also paying full MSRP instead of the grey market price.  
 If you have access to a relative/friend living abroad and are willing to up your budget and make some compromises on movement/build quality, your options expand drastically. Many Seiko models, brands like Vostok, several G Shocks in steel, the list goes on. Browse Chrono24 and see what appeals to you. 
 If I were in your shoes, I would save up for a while and get something truly high quality in the budget range. To name a few commonly recommended options - a used Orient Mako, a WIDE range of Seiko models, some models by Citizen. I did this for 7-8 months until I could spend ~150k on the watch I actually wanted and it was 200% worth the wait.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/Lahore/comments/1ng84ub/best_watches_storeonline_preferred/

Reddit,Thoughts on my itinerary for Rome and Berlin?,edcRachel,"It looks like a lot but it's actually very well grouped together that I think it's possible and not crazy. Will you need rest at all though, especially when you first arrive? Any time for socializing or wandering? Planning to go to any clubs or nightlife? Because this is a very full schedule that doesn't leave a lot of flexibility. It would be much nicer if you could add a couple days. 
 For Berlin: Potsdammer Platz is nothing special IMO and Checkpoint Charlie is more the kind of thing you walk by and go ""huh"" and that's it. TV tower is also whatever, especially if you are doing the Reichstag. However if you have time, I'd highly recommend Sachsenhausen. I would skip other war-related things like Topography of terror in favor of that. But it needs at least a half a day itself, it will take like an hour and a half to get there. 
 Reichstag will need to be booked decently far in advance but there are also sometimes cancellations you can snag. I just made that mistake myself after last going a few years ago and not needing to reserve more than a day out. Colleseum and Sistine Chapel should also be bought in advance. I THINK everything else is fine to wait or doesn't need a reservation. 
 For the metro in Berlin - the passes are REALLY expensive, it only makes sense if you're taking it many times a day or if you get the welcome card because you're going to use a lot of those discounts.

Reddit,Thoughts on my itinerary for Rome and Berlin?,-Gaka-,"Based on my visit to Rome earlier this year.. 
 Depending on how late into the afternoon you arrive, you still have an hour or so trip to Rome proper from the airport, plus any time for hotel and actually getting to your destinations. Take note of that when planning. I did much of what you did on the first day after arriving in the morning - mainly walking around the city with each new attraction as a checkpoint. 
 I would move the Colosseum to probably Sunday, you'll likely spend only about an hour or so there, slightly more if you spring for the floor-level ticket. You'll need the time for Palatine Hill and the Forums, they're genuinely interesting and far vaster than they appear to be.  
 The Vatican museums will also eat up your day, try to get in first thing if you want to see outside of the museum. I didn't care much for the Sistine Chapel, but the rest of the museum was surprisingly secular and you'll get funneled through to see all of it - no need to rush for the big ticket stuff. 
 It looks like you do have plenty of time to walk around the city, which is good - there are a lot of truly interesting museums and locations that won't eat up much time and offer lots.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pnbb09/thoughts_on_my_itinerary_for_rome_and_berlin/

Reddit,Thoughts on my itinerary for Rome and Berlin?,No_Scholar_2646,"You should definitely walk around Museum Island if you’re already doing Berlin Cathedral, even if you don’t go into a museum the area is beautiful. Also don’t skip sunset around the Reichstag / Brandenburg Gate, it hits different in the evening. 
 If you can, book the Reichstag dome in advance because it sells out and it’s actually worth it. When you’re around Potsdamer Platz, don’t feel bad about keeping it short, it’s fine for lunch but not super memorable. 
 You should also 100% add the Jewish Museum Berlin. Even if you don’t spend hours inside, the building itself is a must. It was designed by Daniel Libeskind and the architecture alone is a really powerful experience. It fits well with Topography of Terror and the Holocaust Memorial without feeling repetitive. 
 When you’re at East Side Gallery, you must wander into Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain after, grab a coffee or a beer, that’s where Berlin really feels like Berlin. And honestly, Checkpoint Charlie is very skippable, quick photo max. 
 After Berlin Wall Memorial, walk a bit along Bernauer Straße and then eat around Prenzlauer Berg, that combo feels way more local. If you have extra time or energy, Tempelhofer Feld is such a Berlin thing to do and it’s a nice break from museums.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pnbb09/thoughts_on_my_itinerary_for_rome_and_berlin/

Reddit,Suggestions for East Africa,LifeDuck8914,"Twenty days solo in East Africa sounds absolutely perfect and you're in the ideal position being flexible with no return flight booked yet. your budget is definitely workable but you'll need to be strategic because safari costs can drain that fast, though mixing group tours with independent travel will help you stretch it way further. the fact that you're already doing ocean time with family is smart because that frees you up to focus on the highlands and wildlife areas which are honestly the best parts of kenya and the surrounding countries. 
 I did almost this exact trip in January 2024 after spending Christmas with family in Mombasa, had about eighteen days on my own starting from Nairobi with roughly the same budget. I booked a four day Amboseli and Tsavo safari through Beyond the Plains Safaris which cost me around $1250 all in with park fees and accommodation at Sentrim Amboseli Lodge, and they picked me up right from my Airbnb in Kilimani at 6am which saved me the hassle of coordinating multiple operators. the amboseli views of kilimanjaro at sunrise were unreal and we saw a massive elephant herd crossing right in front of our land cruiser on day two near observation hill. 
 after the safari i took the sgr train from nairobi to mombasa for like twelve bucks just to experience it, then caught a bus up to lamu island for five days which only cost about thirty dollars a day including a guesthouse near the waterfront and meals at whispers coffee shop. with your hiking background you should absolutely consider adding mount kenya or even crossing into tanzania for mount meru which is way less crowded than kilimanjaro and you can do it in three or four days.",5,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1p8pupr/suggestions_for_east_africa/

 If you’re deciding between them, Meru is a fantastic mid level challenge without the crowds. Mt Kenya is also a top pick if you want something epic but not as commercial as Kili.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1p8pupr/suggestions_for_east_africa/
Reddit,Suggestions for East Africa,marktthemailman,"Plenty of options - you could head to lake malawi for a chill experience - the lake is crystal clear and popular with independent travellers.  Nhkata bay is great as is Likoma island.  You can get the mv illala ferry and sleep on the top deck. 
 On the way or instead you can go on a safari from arusha - serengeti, or go on a hike up Mt Meru. 
 Alternatively in 20 days you could head to uganda - go rafting on the nile at Jinja, check out the crater lakes and chimps near Fort Portal.  Go see the gorillas. 
 There are short tours to join that you can arrange in Kampala - e.g to murchison falls NP.  Or go to QE2 NP. 
 You could also go hiking from Lushoto in the Usamabara mountains. 
 All the above you could either arrange in advance or when you get there depending how much you want to organise in advance.

Reddit,Suggestions for East Africa,EditorPuzzleheaded54,"I LOVE Kenya. I just went there for a wedding this year and had the best time, here are my suggestions: 
 Nairobi (4 days): 
 
 Stay in Westlands/Parklands. Felt very safe 
 Cultiva restaurant and Giraffe Centre. Cultiva might be my favourite restaurant in the whole world 
 Artcaffe for breakfast and coffee. Kenya has some of the best coffee in the world 
 The Alchemist or Nairobi Street Kitchen for a good dance/night out 
 Diamond Plaza for the cheapest market, and follow the Maasai market for the biggest market. They move around to different malls throughout the week 
 Carnivore restaurant lets you try all the meat of big game like zebra, crocodile, etc. Little pricey 
 Hashmi BBQ is amazing 
 The Nairobi museum and snake rescue centre is great. You can ask the staff if Raphael will let you hold the snakes and they will most likely say yes and let you hold Raphael Jr. 
 Kesh Kesh cafe for some traditional Eritrean food. The owners are SO nice 
 1 Day Tour Nairobi National Park, Combined The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust‎, Elephant Orphanage 
 
 We went to a resort on the coast in Watamu, but I would suggest going to Diani instead. Sounds like you already have this booked though. 
 Safari: 
 
 Expensive but SO worth it. Many options for this - a quick google will tell you what you need to know. We did a 2 day safari in Maasai Mara, cannot recommend enough. 
 Cheaper safari out of Nairobi in the link above 
 
 If you can go to Tanzania too you won't regret it! 
 
 Zanzibar for blue ass water and amazing beaches. Night markets on the pier.  
 I would recommend Kilimanjaro but you should be training for that before hand and it's a lot more than $2k haha 
 It's quite a bit cheaper in Tanzania so you could maybe find a cheaper safari. I've done a fantastic one in the Ngorongoro Crater

Trying to swindle their monthly retainer could mean forfeiting the tens of thousands they were going to be paid for the month just to cheat the customer out of a thousand.

That makes 4 countries a month, giving you around a week for each excluding travel time between countries. I'm currently travelling around Asia and a week in each country seems really stressful, even if the countries are pretty close. If you actually want to see something in those countries you're going to have to move around a lot. You can of course stay just in one small area of the country and chill, which would be slower. But you do probably want to see things. Just staying in the capitol in every country also gets old fast. Maybe do some research which of those countries you are actually interested in, instead of treating it like a check-list. I haven't been to most of these countries so I don't have concrete tips but I feel like you'd be much less stressed if you did more research. Also that budget is pretty tight.
I feel like you could cut some Balkan countries and you don't need to do every single country in Central Asia. I would personally also cut North Africa because that's just too many regions.

If you like slow travel the pace you propose is the complete opposite. If I were youI'd spend 1 month in Thailand, 10 days in Laos, 10 in Cambodia and 1 month in Vietnam. That's almost 12 weeks. You could shave off a week or two, but for me, 12 weeks seems the right amount of time in that area. That leaves us with 4-8  weeks for central Asia. I have been researching but I didn't get the chance to travel there yet, so take this as what I would do, not what I had done.  
 I'm sure you could see the main things in like 4-6 weeks but distances seem to be big and maybe there's not as much transport availability, but let's say you spend 6 weeks in the region. That leaves us with a couple of weeks maybe. In that time you could go to 1-2 countries in the Caucasus, but it entirely depends on your budget.

 Time is also an expense. The cheapest flights from North America to Southeast Asia usually involve a layover, and total 15-20hrs total travel time. What is the value of an entire day?

I'm going to Senegal in a couple weeks and my hotel is around $90/night, excursions are expensive, and so are transfers. There's hefty taxes around tourism as well.

Ghana and Benin were about the same as Senegal, Gabon and Congo (🇨🇬, not 🇨🇩) are more expensive, Zambia and Zimbabwe are a bit cheaper but still significantly more than SE Asia. Botswana and Namibia aren't necessarily expensive, but safaris are some of the main draws, and there's no such thing as a cheap safari, or at least I wouldn't trust a budget one. 
 I don't think anywhere tops SE Asia in terms of what you get for your money, but there's plenty of other places you can go on a budget and have a great time.

I don’t know the name of the area of town where I stayed, but it was walking distance to a large city park, Bagh-e-Jinnah, which was quite pretty and a pleasant place to chill, and a few other municipal sights. I took a city tour one day to the major sights, such as Lahore Fort, but otherwise I walked around on my own with no issues whatsoever: no significant language barriers, no scammers hassling me in the streets or markets, no unwanted contact.  
 I watched the border crossing ceremony from the Indian side the evening before going to Lahore, so I can’t really speak to the experience from the Pakistani side, though I could see that the crowds were smaller and not as raucous. I’ve read that it’s been curtailed somewhat since the recent war, but maybe it’ll be back to normal by the time you visit. It was great fun.

 You are on the right track with layering.  I am not sure what temperature you will be backpacking but sounds like sub below?  Seems excessive for me but I am a big guy and sweat a lot.  Omni-Heat makes jackets, coats and sweatshirts so I am not sure which one you are considering?  Regardless you want to stay warm and try not to sweat.  I am a big guy and produce a lot of body heat so I get hot quickly.  The setup proposed would be a good sitting around camp but I would just bring a lightweight puffer jacket instead. 
 In my experiment merino wool is superior.  The other synthetic fibers did well but the problem was after 3 days in the backcountry it starts to STINK.  I try washing and scrubbing mud at a water source.  It is terrible.  Merino wool is anti microbial. It regulates body heat better than any synthetic that I have found.

Reddit,Central Asia Tips (20F),NicoRosbot,"Hey another Aussie who knows Chinese. Not a lot of Aussies in Central Asia in general.  
 There's a pretty established backpacker trail through Uzbekistan now. Can second Old Radio Hostel as an excellent social hostel, they organise trips across the border to Tajikistan too since the border crossing there is quite easy. Uzbekistan in general is pretty cheap. It was really hot when I was there though (especially Khiva), and that was late June. 2 days each in Tashkent, Samarqand, Bukhara and Khiva (including desert fortresses) is the standard route, possibly adding Chimgan/Charvak, or Shahrisabz and Termez if you like history. Make sure to book your trains a few weeks early, they will sell out quickly. 
 Not actually a lot of good hostels I found in Kazakhstan, but there's a two day Kolsai/Kaindy/Charyn Canyon tour from Almaty that usually has a lot of early 20s solo travellers and has a really good atmosphere to it. Riding around in Soviet vans, riding horses, sleeping in yurts. Had a great time, and met travellers later on who said they had the same experience. Also in Kazakhstan I actually had better luck speaking Chinese than English outside of tourist spots.  
 Not really a hidden gem, but Almaty has some really nice hikes. Kokzhailau, and the one that goes past the hot springs.  
 And its tempting to skip Khiva since its out of the way from the rest of Uzbekistan and a pain to get to, but its probably the most special place in all of Central Asia for me. Stay at the Orient Star hotel, its inside the famous madrassah. Despite what the Uzbekistan rail website states, there exists a night train out of Khiva to Bukhara so you don't waste a full day looking at the Kyzylkum desert out the window.

Reddit,Central Asia Tips (20F),Akrupt,"Aussie boy currently in Uzbek. $12k will be enough if you’re smart - Turkmenistan can be done for under 1k, but I’ve skipped it. Addressing some of your questions.  
 June/July is peak season especially for the outdoor hikes and trek, it’s also peak summer so it’s hot.  
 Almaty to Bishkek is easy by bus / shared car. Shared transport is very common in Kyrg, and also seems to be a thing here in Uzbek. 
 Going south from Almaty and to Kyrg and Across to Uzbek (detour to Tajik and Turkmen) saves travelling across Kazakh, and you can pop back up to the West of Kazakh (Aktau). All the locals in Almaty told me to skip Astana - so I did.  
 Kazakh - Panda Tours and similar, will take you to the major nature spots around Almaty in 1 or 2 days (Kaidy lake was a favourite). There’s also plenty of hikes from the city. I haven’t gotten to west Kazakh yet, but from Aktau lots of access to the Mangystau region, they have a local version of Uluṟu. Much like Almaty has Asia’s Grand Canyon.  
 Kyrg/Bishkek - song kul lake horse trek is the most accessible, but there are plenty of other options too. Outside of treks not much to do and you’ll probably move on fast.

 How long to spend in each country 
 
 You should probably research places you want to visit and come to that decision yourself? 
 
 If $12000 AUD is enough for 3 months?? 
 
 Yes. 
 
 When the best time to visit is (I'll be heading around june/july, but want to make sure there will be lots of other travellers there at the same time) 
 
 It's going to be hot as fuck in some places. Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan should be good around then.

Reddit,Central Asia Tips (20F),Rad_Streak,"OP says she's been to 40+ countries by the age of 20 and has 12,000$ for this trip + unlimited time to take it. 
 I think it'd help to know what kind of trips she's been on before you can really recommend anything. To me that seems like a person who is used to probably more touristy destinations and always paying for the 'authentic' experience of tour guides and local culture experts who's livelihood is entertaining foreigners. 
 I think visiting Afghanistan under Taliban rule isn't a very great idea as a female foreigner. Nor is visiting Russia as it's currently embroiled in a huge war that it is more than willing to take hostages in to further it's goals. See the American basketball player that was arrested in Russia on minor charges then traded for an arms dealer that was in an American prison. 
 If OP's worried about the budget she should probably cut out the two most unreliable nations in terms of security. That gives her more time to do everything else and take in some of the largest/most populated countries on Earth.

I started with very small investment and grew it enough that I make 100 times of it per month. Thing is, I spent time learning before investment. Then worked 14 hours a day for 4 years-weekday, weekends, holidays. If customer called, I would be there even if it meant skipping food and sleep.

 From my time learning at job, I had enough work references that were willing to invest. I knew that if I worked extra 2 years, I can be my own boss without any partnership. And that is what I did. 
 So my honest brotherly advise is, to forget that someone actually capable will partnership with you.

 Going off the beaten track works better on the country level. Look at a map. Pick a country you know nothing about. Look it up on wikivoyage. Do your research into that country. Don't obsess with being the only tourist but there's plenty of places in the world that don't have a huge number of tourists.

 Personal example: When I went Guatemala, a lot of my cursory research was telling me to get out of the capital and explore the volcanos, lakes, ruins…but I know myself. I love contemporary art, brutalist architecture, big cities. I went against the grain and spent a week in Guatemala City. I found some academic papers about modern architecture from the 1950-70s and put together some walking tours- everything from government buildings to schools to funeral homes. I visited the modern art museum (fantastic!!) as well as asked on forums for suggestions of other smaller art galleries to visit.

 My must-sees are pretty personal because I don't follow travel blogs or influencers and do minimal research beforehand. At most I just look at Google images and make a mental note of things that take my fancy. 
  On my first evening in a place, once I'm all checked in, I either wander the area randomly or look at what's nearby on Google maps, clicking on what look like points of interest or just heading to the nearest ""busy area"" or seaside or riverside or park or whatever. I might eventually Google ""things to do in X"" if I've run out of things to do or if there's so much that I don't want to regret missing something I'd especially enjoy.  
 Of course I also consider recommendations/plans of fellow travellers I meet but those can be hit or miss. 
 Quite often, I have no idea whether what I find will be super popular or off-the-beaten-track. Sometimes even the most touristy thing ever is my own personal ""hidden gem"" because I've just stumbled upon it.

 The thing about amazing places is that they are amazing, and people want to see them.  
 Particularly for your first trip, I recommend going exclusively to ""touristy"" places. They are easy to navigate and stunning. While you're there, get comfortable with the country, maybe meet a local or two, ask for suggestions off the beaten track, and plan to return.  
 I am on my 5th trip to Europe and, so far, it's been mostly ""touristy"" spots. Finally, this time, I feel confident that I can go to Lyon instead of Paris, or Montepulciano instead of Florence - but I'm sure glad i went to Paris and Florence first.  
 Also, watch the people in this thread flame me for Lyon and Montepulciano being ""touristy"" as well.  
 To me it's a false dichotomy. Go the places you're interested in, and ignore the other tourists. You'll be fine.",14,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pv21v4/historic_or_beautiful_spots_that_are_not_touristy/

 Another option is to go off season.  The major tourist trail is very nice for a lot of reasons that you might want to visit, but in February or March it is vastly less touristed than June.  For example, if you wanted to hit Amsterdam, hotels outside of De Wallen (the main tourist ares) are under a hundred bucks right now because there are fewer tourists in zones that are typically far less touristed anyway, and still interesting as well as close enough that you can go see the more heavily touristed areas.",6,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pv21v4/historic_or_beautiful_spots_that_are_not_touristy/

 We visited Germany this year and toured many palaces in Baden and Bavaria, and had many places almost to ourselves.  (Yes, if you go to Neuschwanstein it will be packed, because it is unique, but many places are that popular.)   In 2 palaces, we were the only people in the group (some places can only be visited on guided tours and they may only be offered in German, but there is an English tour card in each room that gives an explanation), in others there were only 4 to 8 people in the group.  Some of these palaces were in towns visited by river tours, so the local cafes were packed at lunchtime.  It sounds crazy, and prolly hard to believe, but I have photos.   
 Here’s the thing; I’m debating whether I should publish a list, because that’s how things get overrun.  You have to do a little research to find them.  Instead of looking for tourist attractions, focus on a theme like archetecture or history and then visit places that speak to your interest.  It takes time, and I wouldn’t expect overwhelming success on your first effort, but I guarantee you will find amazing places.   
 Another approach I have used with success is to visit foreign discussion threads, like  r/Germany  on Reddit, and look for interesting photos to develop a list of interesting places to visit.

I can make my peace with a place being touristy, if it’s a man-made attraction. Of course I’d always still prefer experiencing something with less crowds if possible, but the reality is, famous landmarks are famous for a reason and I’m also just a tourist like everybody else.  
 What I have a problem with is when I want to enjoy nature and humans have turned it into a money-making scheme by packing as many people as possible, to the point that it’s all one big photoshoot for wannabe influencers and nobody’s there for the natural scenery or worse, disrespecting and ruining the environment.  
 As for finding those “hidden gems” that aren’t overrun with tourists, yes, they are definitely out there. For example, many European countries have charming small towns which offer similar vibes to the large cities, minus the big, famous castle or museum that everyone goes to see.

When you get off the beaten path locals might not speak English at all. If it's your first time traveling to Europe, I'm not so sure whether it's a good idea to detour from the touristy places initially unless you speak any of the local languages. Europe has so many cultures too it might come as a shock. Get accustomed to the basics in the country first, then it'll be easier to make detours and explore more. I think that'd be a good common ground for you and your husband! 
 When I went to Iceland, I visited the most popular places at first and they were filled with crowds unfamiliar with the environment. It did take a little away from these places but allowed me to get accustomed to the country. The sights were amazing nonetheless.

In some places there was no mobile network, locals didn't speak any English, and the road conditions were tough. But, I was prepared since I had had time to get acquainted with everything.

 Romania is a wonderful travel destination.  UNESCO-listed Sighișoara has a medieval fortress that's actually still inhabited.  There's a functioning town inside the medieval walls. Brașov is a lovely historic city, as are Sibiu and Cluj-Napoca.  A real hidden gem is Oradea, near the border with Hungary.  It's full of recently-restores Baroque and (especially) Art Nouveau architecture.  It's one of the most beautiful small cities we've ever visited. 
 Bosnia has beautiful scenery and historic towns.  There are disturbing reminders of the '92-'95 civil war, but that's also part of the experience.  Sarajevo, which has come back after the war, is a lovely city, with a historic Ottoman-era quarter. 
 Bulgaria is another great destination.  We especially loved Plovdiv, which has ancient Roman sites, interesting museums, and the longest pedestrian-only street in Europe.  
 Moravia, in the eastern part of Czechia (Czech Republic) is much less touristy than places like Prague or Český Krumlov (although these are also worth visiting).  Kroměříž has two UNESCO-listed sites, but not very many tourists.  Olomouc is another beautiful and often-overlooked town. 
 My wife and I spent 2 1/2 weeks in former Soviet Georgia last spring, and we loved it.  Interesting and historic cities, great food and wine -- wine was invented there --- nice people, amazing public markets.  And it's quite inexpensive. 
 Everyone who visits Turkey comes back saying they loved it.  Istanbul is unquestionably one of the greatest cities in the world.

 The most common destinations all certainly have their appeal, and there are phenomenal things to see there, don’t get me wrong, but often when you’re at a common destination it will feel as if there’s a checklist of places to visit whether or not you really want to. In Paris, for example, you’ll feel like you  have  to see the Louvre even if you’re not into renaissance art and the Eiffel Tower, catacombs, Versailles, Notre Dame, etc etc. Those are great things to see, but you’ll be doing the same trip that a hundred million other people have done.

Reddit,Planning my first SOLO trip - Is HK worth it?,mrabacus927,"Hong Kong is not intimidating for first time travelers, it might be one of the easier asian cities for westerners due to the fact that English is a co-official language and most of the population speaks it to different degrees. Street signs, instructions, etc are all in English and Cantonese/Mandarin. Very safe place, day or night. 
 I was there a year ago and its a city I really liked. It's definitely a ""vibes"" type of place, either you vibe with the city or you wont. The city was the most capitalistic place on earth for a good part of the XX century up till the beginning of the present century so most of the historical architecture was demolished and replaced by new buildings.  
 If you go I recommend the Symphony of Lights, taking the Star Ferry at sunset, the Symphony of Lights at night, HK Maritime Museum and HK History Museum to learn the peculiar history of the city (note that the History one has been taken over by the CCP so it has a bias that will perhaps surprise many westerners). Chungking Mansions is a very odd place, not sure if as a woman you'll feel comfortable visiting, I assume yes since there are many hostels there (the most affordable places are there). You can do a lot of hiking, as much as it shocks people, most of Hong Kong is actually protected natural parks, so there is a lot of nature right next to the city. You can also visit the park where Kowloon Walled City used to be, but to fully appreciate it you should research what this place was before it was demolished. 
 For a day trip you can go to Macau, just a 1 hour trip by ferry. There are ferries every hour or so. Buses also go there. Macau is quite different; the historic center is Portuguese architecturally speaking (it was a portuguese colony for centuries, until 1999 technically speaking), the rest of the city is a modern Chinese city, giving it a very eclectic feel. Some beautiful chinese temples and catholic churches side by side, and many stores sell portuguese pastries and food, even if the people there don't speak portuguese and are not for the most part of portuguese ancestry. Then you have of course the casinos, which are quite awe inducing. I am a bit ashamed to admit, even as someone who does not care about betting and prefers historical sites, that the casinos surprised me a lot. I enjoyed spending a few hours inside, really beautiful buildings.

The first three days of the new year (17-19) are public holidays. Plan accordingly, as you may see some places closed and the price of accommodation can be even higher than usual. 
 As for itinerary, the most logical thing would be to break it up by region. Hong Kong overall isn't that big (especially the parts a tourist would visit) but you can easily fill up your time with shopping since you seem interested in that, so you can spend a lot of time in one district. Maybe spend one day on HK Island to do Victoria Peak and you can do your shopping in Central and Causeway Bay. Then the next day you can do Kowloon (TST, Avenue of Stars, Mong Kok, Ladies Market).

 Not intimidating for a solo traveler at all! The bus system is fairly easy to get around after some trial and error for me (I only got a day to learned but figured it out). 
 For a day, it was nice to know what HK was all about but I would not stay there for longer personally. I’ve spent about $200 some L’occitane and Laneige skincare products and it’s the same price as I would spend in the US (I even checked the prices before buying).

Reddit,Planning my first SOLO trip - Is HK worth it?,deleted,"HK is honestly one of the easiest places you can do for a first solo trip. Super safe, public transport is idiot-proof, and no one bothers you. You can literally just wander around and eat/shop all day. 
 Your itinerary already hits the big spots, but I’d add:
-PMQ – cute local shops and cafés
-Star Street/Wan Chai – super chill area to explore
-Tai O – if you want something more “local” and quiet
-K11 Musea – great for skincare + just a nice place to roam around 
 Skincare shopping there is dangerous btw, you’ll walk into Sasa or Colourmix “just to look” and come out broke. 😂 
 If you’re nervous about going solo, don’t be HK is very solo-traveler friendly. You’ll be totally fine and probably have a great time. 
 Btw if you want to find all sorts of cool hidden gems I highly recommend this website called WanderVlogs, it’s a website which I found recently and it essentially takes long vlogs posted by content creators and sorts them into short bite sized clips according to destination.

Reddit,Trip report: 5 weeks in the Balkans/Eastern Europe,mossimo654,"Great questions. I did book accommodation ahead of time. I had no idea what to expect. I think during the summer if you’re choosy, doing that is definitely the way to go. Some of these towns have very few pensiune available. Others like vatra dornei are quite large and I’m sure it would be easier to find accommodation last minute. Most people staying in the guesthouses were Romanian tourists, not Transilvanica hikers. So I’m sure if you’re doing it not during peak Romanian vacation time it’d be less busy. If you wanted to keep it more spontaneous and book accommodation late I’d definitely recommend taking a tent just in case. 
 I had one quite scary sheepdog experience. Had four surround me and lunge at me aggressively until the shepherds called them off. After that I started carrying a large stick and some sausages just in case 🤣. Haven’t heard of anyone getting injured but it was definitely a scary experience. No bears or anything but there are warning signs everywhere and I know people see them in Bucovina. 
 Edit: in terms of recommendations for accommodation I can only recommend places in the bucovina section. Staying at the monastery near Putna wasn’t “nice” but it was an unforgettable cultural experience! Poiana de vis in sucevita was quite nice but they didn’t have dinner. Casa severin in Sadova was quite rustic (basically someone’s house) and the husband of the host was extremely drunk the entire time.

Also the best solution is if this kinda behavior is actively punished.
Imagine would anyone of you. Police and laws need to be implemented and in tourist spots or place which are crowded need to be monitored and the accused need to be punished.

Reddit,Solo travel to Croatia. Is this a solid itinerary?,petarpetrovicc,"3 nights in Split sounds perfect, but your island plan feels a bit rushed. Personally, I’d choose Hvar (Hvar Town) and stay 2 nights instead of splitting time between Hvar and Brač. From Hvar you can actually catch a catamaran directly to Dubrovnik in about 3.5 hours (I think it runs until around 1.11, but double-check the schedule, also just keep in mind that the catamaran Split- Dubrvnik isn’t cheap, it’s around €50 one way, but in this case I think it’s worth paying at in one direction to save time and hassle). Then you can take bus back up to Split. 
 From both Split and Hvar you can easily book full-day boat trips to nearby islands like Vis (Stiniva Beach), Biševo (Blue Cave), Brač, etc. Some tours even cover multiple islands in one day. If you want Krka National Park, I’d do that as a day trip from Split. 
 Aside from giving yourself more time on one island, your plan looks solid. 
 Nightlife: Split is your best bet. Just keep in mind that it depends on the season, most clubs close in winter. In the Old Town, check out 305 Central and Boiler. A cool hidden gem is Matejuška, where locals (especially younger crowds) hang out and drink. Roof 68 does have a nice view, but for me its a tourist trap. 
 Food in Split: Bokeria, Corto Maltese,  Bokamorra great pizza, Plan B burgers, Gelateria Emiliana ice cream 
 Cocktail bars: Bar Sistema, Strings, Paloma Nera, all do excellent signature cocktails. 
 Hvar: I haven’t been in a while, but nightlife there isn’t quite like it used to be. Locals cracked down because of too many drunk tourists causing chaos in the old town. Nowadays, Split has more of that “party reputation,” so just please be respectful wherever you go :) 
 Dubrovnik: Absolutely worth experiencing, it’s gorgeous. Walk the City Walls, take the cable car, explore the Old Town. Nightlife, the most famous club is Revelin (inside the fortress), and for pubs there’s Fontana. If you want a food spot with incredible views, I highly recommend Restaurant Panorama. You can get there by cable car or taxi. It’s not budget-friendly, but worth it if you can afford it.
Just note Dubrovnik is by far the most expensive city in Croatia. and if you want to eat and drink for less, go outside the city walls. 
 Transport: I don’t think renting a car is worth it for this route. If you’re flying into Split, there are direct buses from the airport to the city center (if you use a taxi, stick to Uber, private taxis often overcharge).",6,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1nnra0k/solo_travel_to_croatia_is_this_a_solid_itinerary/

If look at a map you'll see that the Vatican is whitin the city of Roma. It's just a series of building and plaza in the city. Anyway I'll suggest to plan 1 day for it, the vatican Museum is huge, you can also climb the dome of St Peter amd visit the basilica. 
 Milano has lot to offer but is often overlooked due to its fame as a business city. 2 days there can be enough however  
 You can do 3 day Roma, 3 days Florence and 2 days Milano. You'll notice that adds up to 8 days. That's because moving from one city to the next will take a day. Even with high speed train the whole process (check out, go to station, travel, reach hotel, check-in) will take the best part of a day. If you time it right it could be just half day.

Madrid has more museums and better priced when it comes to Barcelona, each neighbourhood has its own center whereas in Barcelona there is just one center, sure you can find small nice squares to rest but it's a different vibe. Think Barcelona is not flat as Madrid, so everything will be uphill or downhill. Madrid does not have medieval quarters as Barcelona does, that's a point for Barcelona, but in Catalonia, the old quarters are also the dirtiest, dilapidated ones, while they are very touristic, it can be stressful to navigate while being aware of your surroundings. I am not going to minimize security too.

To some extent they all give each others workers food whenever they can. They are mostly modest.

Yes nearly everyone uses the government veichels for personal use leaving a few (my family doesnt use either). Another bad thing is funding for homes, An amount aloted to repair, paint, add, renovate or construct to for government homes. Housing provided by government. 
 Also dont hate on housing provided by government as officers usually have to move places, districts and cities every now an then. Getting your own house then waiting for it to sell takes very long, these houses are paid usually a subsidised rent, not all officers get paid the same etc. Its usually people who climb too high too fast, they get curropted.

As you said, it’s a delicate balance, you have to present yourself well while also not crossing over into pretending to be different than you are.  
 I’m afraid there’s no one size fits all answer to this, I’d just advise you to be as respectful and polite as you would be with any other elders. Don’t try to suppress your personality or thoughts excessively - if there is something integral to you that they object to, its better to find out now rather than you keeping yourself restrained for who knows how long. 
 Its also very important to be humble, you could be the most educated person in the world and still have something to learn from other people. I’ve met lots of people who were perhaps less educated in the traditional way, it doesn’t mean I’m better than them in any way or vice versa, just that your differences from someone can be an opportunity to learn from them.  
 When I met my to be in-laws for the first time, I mostly just stayed quite polite and tried to present myself well, and my parents talked with them as well of course.

Reddit,Is it possible to trust the Internet for food recommendations while on vacation anymore?,Amockdfw89,"Exactly. People assume  popular means tourist trap.  
 A tourist trap is if you go to, I don’t know, some place in Mexico where the waitstaff wears indigenous costumes, the whole place has a jungle temple theme, they serve frozen chicken tenders and basic bar food, every Saturday is a “traditional show” of fire dancing and drumming, while every Sunday night is a cover band playing soft rock. Then in the front they got a shop that sells brides t shirts and shot glasses. THAT is a tourist trap.  
 Also just because locals eat there don’t mean it is a sign of authenticity or quality.  
 It just means it’s a sign of popularity or convenience. If you ask me where the locals eat on my side of town I’d tell you the bar and grill down the street. The food is basic but filling, they sell cheap beer, they play every sport on tv, they have pool tables and it’s pretty close. 
 Are there a million better restaurants around here? Sure! Lots of good bbq, authentic Mexican food, hole in the wall soul food places, and a town or two over lots of great middle eastern restaraunts and then endless amounts of Asian cuisine further afield. 
 But many people just head down to the basic bar and grill for convenience, consistency and a menu that will have something to please everyone in your group  
 My ex wife is from Morocco and she said tourist would always ask her that. She would just tell them “I like the old lady who has the cart that sells flat bread wraps with onions, tomato chili sauce and canned sardines” why?

 Eh, I think this advice gets overplayed on reddit. It's fine, but no more reliable than putting in research on the right platform that locals use. 
 Firstly, scoping out places for 'locals' doesn't make practical sense in a lot of countries. You're not not reliably able to profile people in most places in Europe or asia, for example. 
 And imo plently of locals eat shitty food too. My city is known for mexican, and many shitty mexican restaurants are packed every day with mexican people on every other corner. 
 I don't know man. I've done a lot of research for my trips about what platforms to trust  most  in each locale, and cross reference my choices on the web and have eaten at some pretty world class places 99.99% of the time and very rarely get burned. This whole thread screams 'skill issue' to me. It's pretty easy to spot tourist traps with even minimal research just from looking at the actual reviews and photos.

It's just that you wouldn't trust the average person to tell you what the best painting is, or to identify a great tailored suit, or to spot a high quality antique. They're just not that into that stuff to have developed an eye for it. So why would they be able to tell an ok restaurant from a good one, or more importantly a good from great, when they don't actually have that much experience in food either?  
 Food is so much about the occasion, too. Beautiful surroundings, great company, after a brilliant day and with a few drinks. Those meals will get rated highly because they're about the event as much as what's on the plate.  
 Be careful with where the locals go though. I don't choose the best possible meal where I live. I choose convenience, price and often ""will this do, I can't be arsed to cook"". I wouldn't highly recommend the place I go most often, it's just closest to my house and is absolutely fine! If you're a tourist in my town, I'd send you elsewhere for a really nice meal.  
 Having said that, I wouldn't consider anything below 4 stars in reviews usually.

Reddit,Is it possible to trust the Internet for food recommendations while on vacation anymore?,onexbigxhebrew,"I think you're in your own head about this. You gotta use a combination of sources and compare, and use different tools based on the country. Good example is Tokyo - google reviews are essentiallly gamed by tourist traps to the point of irrelevence there. Google is a good way to quickly  disqualify  things, but you also need to then check the place on tabelog and also understand their scoring, etc. As that's what locals use. 
 The best way to use the internet for this stuff is to mix quantitative and qualitative reviews, and find sources you like and develop some trust. But the intermet isn't any more or less reliable than the sources of the past - it was youtube, travel blogs, guidebooks, travel agents, friends etc before that and all with just as big of a chance of paid or bad information. 
 Tbh, on a side note I'm starting to find that reddit is kind out of the know on stuff and doesn't align with my interests because most redditors are famously cheap and lazy, and a lot just parrot eachother.

Reddit,Is it possible to trust the Internet for food recommendations while on vacation anymore?,Hour_Significance817,"Look at Google reviews. The ones that have a rating above 4.5/5 are suspicious for buying reviews, especially if the number of reviews exceed a few dozens. The ones at or above 4.8/5 definitely have their reviews that are not based on an authentic experience (either directly buying reviews from review farms, or indirectly with customer bribes e.g. 5 star reviews for a free drink, etc.). No matter how good a restaurant is, at least 10% of people won't be happy and will be nitpicky about it, and getting anything within a few percentage point of a perfect 5/5 means that someone's been fudging with the number. 
 On the flip side, the standards of Google reviews are also quite cultural. In most places, a review under 3.5/5 typically means that there's something wrong with the business. In certain countries, e.g. Japan, 3/5 means that it's decent, and anything close to 4/5 means that it's pretty damn good.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pttfi5/is_it_possible_to_trust_the_internet_for_food/

Reddit,Is it possible to trust the Internet for food recommendations while on vacation anymore?,Dry-Cow4066,No. Everyone thinks The Best insert food in all of insert country.  I would not recommend any restaurants in Tuscany because I like certain foods. With foreign travel look for obvious signs like menus outside of restaurants or English signs. However you may enjoy the food. Price point is big for me. I'm a good cook so I don't want to overpay for tourist food. Michelin star is a no go for me.

I wanted hashbrowns with the caveat that I didn't want home fries  and I wanted them to be extra crispy.   
 90% of the responses I received were people telling me their favorite hash browns which were either: 
 
 Home fries 
 Super ridiculously large portions (because America) that are too thick to actually get crispy

Reddit,Is it possible to trust the Internet for food recommendations while on vacation anymore?,internalasteroid,"I use a mix of sources. You can search Google maps for food groups and it identifies popular places for you - for Western (European/Antipodean) countries I always Google specialty coffee and organic wine and get an idea of what areas of a city have those things (and generally the vibe I want). I also really like coffee and basic Google searching can tell you if a place has a regional way of making it to try 
Google maps you need to look at photos and where the reviewers are from.
Cheap and cheerful places can be found around universities, also always worth looking up what the main immigrant groups are in a city or country, breaks up a trip and also you get amazing food you might not be able to get at home.
Major cities also often have (sometimes in English, sometimes not) more traditional restaurant only reviewers eg. Le Fooding for France and Belgium gives great recommendations.
I also look at Michelin gourmand for recent recommendations - they're for places that are more affordable and a lot of the time are restaurants that do local cuisine. Don't go somewhere that was awarded like 10 years ago only - they would have changed staff etc.
Lastly before going on a trip get recommendations from anyone in the area - I ask friends of friends if I know someone is from Barcelona etc and those are the best, even if just telling you what specific local breakfast item to look out for.
In SEA Asia honestly just walk around and visit any bakery with lines. And whatever street food looks good.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pttfi5/is_it_possible_to_trust_the_internet_for_food/

Reddit,Is it possible to trust the Internet for food recommendations while on vacation anymore?,MightyManorMan,"Like all statistics, you can only trust if the demographic and data set is correct. For that reason, I don't trust the following: 
 TripAdvisor. The demographic is all wrong. It's not locals who are telling you about local food. It's tourists telling you about tourist oriented restaurants. (It's a company that chased away all their great reviewers by alienating the properties that actually sent people to review them... B&Bs. People who stay at B&Bs are looking for a local experience, so they went to local restaurants, stayed at small hotels. People who stay at giant hotels in the CBD aren't looking for local and authentic, because there is nothing authentic about a Hilton or a Hyatt.) 
 Influencers. Especially influencers who don't disclose if they are paid. Because if they are paid, well, at least I know they are being honest about it. If they clearly indicate that they are never paid, then maybe they have a valid point. But most are dishonest and don't disclose that their are paid. Doesn't matter if they are on Insta, TikTok or YouTube... 
 Sources I do trust: 
 Michelin... and not the 1*, 2* and 3*, but the other lists, Bib Gourmand and the Selected Restaurants. I'm not looking for a pretentious meal, I'm looking for good local eats. 
 Google Reviews... and only after reading them and that there are enough reviews and sorted by newest, to ensure they are still maintaining. You have to see what people say and if it's locals who are saying it. And what they like about the menu. Recently were in the NL and it suggested a Japanese resto right across the street... and damn was it good food for a great price. 
 Walking by... if the restaurant is empty... never a good sign. If it's dinner time and you have to hope for a seat... good place. 
 Locals... they want you to enjoy their city. They will be honest and tell you, for the most part.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pttfi5/is_it_possible_to_trust_the_internet_for_food/
Reddit,Is it possible to trust the Internet for food recommendations while on vacation anymore?,adamr81,"It's much harder in Western countries to find the best foods, especially in the US. When I plan it's very focused on key words and geography. I like to make a few reservations at can't miss restaurants but like to keep my trips unplanned for walk-ins and recommendations. 
 I start with the Michelin guides to understand the overall quality/type of food and get a feel for the area.  Then go to Reddit but I look for very specific lists.  I look for the best cocktails bars - first because we love cocktails, second it's very easy to determine bad cocktails/tourist traps from the pictures and menus, third there is less paid advertising in this space. Once I find the late night spots then I narrow my food search to these areas. Good cocktail restaurants are generally in popular areas where other good food exists.  
 I then look specifically for ""date night"" dinner options. For me that is the best qualifier for high quality restaurants visited by locals. Then once vacation starts all of my choices come from walking around or recommendations.  When asking for recommendations don't just openly ask, give them a qualifier - I loved this one restaurant, can you recommend others like it?  Who do I ask for recommendations? Bartenders - if it's just my wife and I we will eat at the bar and get to know the bartenders and ask for their recommendations - because by this time we've spoken for a bit and they get a feel for us and what we are looking for, plus service industry knows the behind closed doors stuff and about recommending places with terrible owners and bad reputations. I never ask hotels for recommendations unless it's a small town with few options.   
 Other rules of mine while traveling: no fast food, no chain restaurants, generally no hotel restaurants (except in Asian countries), no restaurants within a 5ish block radius of a tourist spot, remember you are free to walkout at any time - I have left many restaurants after sitting down and looking at the menu and the plates of food around me.",0,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pttfi5/is_it_possible_to_trust_the_internet_for_food/
Reddit,Is it possible to trust the Internet for food recommendations while on vacation anymore?,Amockdfw89,"Honestly i mean these days I don’t really care  “about eating what locals eat” it is a chore many times and it doesn’t mean it is a sign of authenticity, just a sign of popularity. 
 Maybe I will go to one or two restaraunts but most the time I just prepare simple meals myself or take out prepared foods from grocery stores, delis or service stations which can honestly be super underrated while also being more truly what the locals eat. 
 But what I found helped a lot is cross referencing by looking at Google and Yelp. I also make sure I look at newest reviews since some places can get better or worst over time.  
 Most importantly I focus  on the 3 and 4 star reviews. 3 and 4 star reviews tend to be more honest and a truer reflection of the place. A lot of people will give a review of 5 stars if service is attentive or they had an awesome time there, even if the food isn’t the best. Many people will give a restaurant 1 star because even if the food is good, maybe the waiter forgot an appetizer or they ran out of their favorite beer, so they knee jerk and give a one star review.  
 3 or 4 stars tend to have more nuance. Maybe the food is average but they have one or two specialities they do better than everyone in town. Maybe the steaks are horrible but the seafood is divine. Maybe the entrees suck, but the appetizers, bar and ambience is top notch so it’s worth going too for something casual. Maybe the food isn’t good but the service and wait time is so long and horrible that it just isn’t worth going there. 
 Those are the kind of things you learn about in 3 and 4 star reviews, as opposed to 1 and 5 star reviews which can be knee jerk and usually tend to be very specific to that specific reviewers want and needs",0,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pttfi5/is_it_possible_to_trust_the_internet_for_food/

 for comparison many people working office jobs in Pakistan have salary of 1-2 lakh per month, and that's considered a reasonable salary to support a family. 3+ lakh per month is considered an excellent salary. if someone is making 10 lakh per month, that's unusually high for Pakistan.  
 so if you have 12 lakh to spend over 40 days, it will be more than enough, provided you're not getting consistently ripped off. i'd recommend you budget a little, such as not going only to designer places for clothes (where some shops will charge 1-2 lakh+ for an outfit).",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1psbtej/spending_money_for_trip_to_pakistan/

 Part of my inspiration to visit now was to try to see it before any other sites are potentially demolished, or it gets even more touristy. For now though, I don’t think over tourism is a problem.

 Im pretty sure cameras and microphones are pretty common for most taxis or ride hailing services in china. 
 If i was a local and a gwailou asked me these stupid questions i would just deflect it too. 
 Like think about it. If the driver said “oh yess they are listening” is he really gonna be sent straight to reeducation camp? Like why only monitor and listen to taxi/didi/tour drivers? What about all the other people who dont work in a car and dont need to have a camera and speaker for safety reasons? How do the evil cee cee pee monitor them? The kebab shop owner on the side of the road? What about him? How come he doesnt have a listening device monitoring every conversation he has with customers? 
 And “who” is listening? The taxi company? The local government? The ministry of public security? 
 This is what i cant stand about westerners who travel to XJ, they always seem to go in with preconceived ideas and blow up the littlest thing to play into the thing people wanna hear about the place, that something bad is happening there. 
 It even happens in normal cities, like the number of times first time travellers go to shanghai or something and think all the “bao an” security dudes are like cops or something and some part of the big brother authoritarian security apparatus lmao jst cause they dress bit like cops. Like no lmao theyre either uncs or some 20 something yr old dude who jst wants to get through their shift and not piss off all the passengers who have to go through x-ray bag checks whilst actually looking like theyre doing their jobs.  
 Or theyre like “brooo check out all da cctv cameras?” Because they got told china is a surveillance state so now they go to china and consciously become aware of all these cameras. But for me i dont even care about it enough to label it with loaded terms like “surveillance”: yes theres more cameras than most western cities but jts not something notice or consciously look for because i dont go to china to see the china the western msm keeps telling me about which is this authoritarian 1984 esque surveillance state where you get your “soCiAl CrEdIt ScOre” deducted for jaywalking but ofc if thats what youre looking for then ofc you will find it if you look hard enough. (Edit: social credit score is not real and the wikipedia article on it is ridiculous lmao the more important thing there is the talk tab where you can see the debate going back and forth on the validity of the article”) 
 Yes, there is more security than other places due to the terrorist attacks but is it rlly anymore than a normal day on Beijing Road SH or Nanjing Rd GZ where cops and their armoured vans are in every intersection or at Shanghai Railway Station outside the square where Peoples Armed police guard the place with assault rifles? 
 xinjiang is one of the top domestic tourism destinations in china, my sister and mum went there way back in 2019. Millions of chinese visit there a year yet none of them talk about the place like the western msm or westerners talk about it because 99% its rlly jst another part of china apart from the scenery and local culture and ethnic groups. You go to urumqi and theres the same restuarant and shopping chains, you got your chagee, your starbucks and kfc and your usual chinese shops and most of the locals even if they are not han can speak mandarin fine.",17,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1om9qor/10_days_in_xinjiang_western_china/

Reddit,Feedback on 3-week India itinerary,how-why,"I would try and slow down a little bit and do less things. Can't speak to the heat because we did this stuff during winter. 
 At a high level, because India is in general a more difficult place to travel, then the faster you move, the harder it is. Which is true everywhere, but like exponentially true in India. Whereas if you stay longer in a spot, then the more days you have to do like 1 thing only, or taking a full rest day in between activities, the better. 
 Looking at the number of activities you have planned per day looks exhausting! Truly I think doing 1-2 things per day, plus eating a few meals, will be much more enjoyable. 
 For driver, the hotels are good at connecting you with where to find drivers. We took a bus from Udaipur to Jodhpur and that worked well for us.

 If I may make a few suggestions, drop day 14 in Udaipur. Monsoon palace is just ruins that's not even maintained well. Instead consider taking a day trip to Chittorgarh Fort.  
 How about taking a relaxed walk on Marine Drive on day 17 in Mumbai? Also, why Oval Maidan? It's nice but nothing for a tourist. Try to see if you can fit in Elephanta Caves from Mumbai. You'll get ferries from Gateway of India.  
 Central Sikh Museum is a bit meh, very skippable. But Golden Temple is a great experience and you can get a wonderful view of the GT from the top of the nearby Baba Atal Rai gurudwara. That one's really worth a visit for both the view and the gurudwara itself.  
 You can hire a car and driver by asking at your hotel. They'll give you options. You can even message them and ask in advance.  
 Just be careful of the heat. The heat isn't like the SEA heat. Drink water, cover up, avoid exposure as much as possible in Delhi / Rajasthan. Mumbai is coastal, so heat would be more sweaty.

Expect tempperature to go beyond 45 degrees in places like Jaipur, Udaipur and Delhi at that time. The small grace is that at least it will be all dry heat, not humid heat. So as long as you stay in shade or in AC, you will be fine.

 Stay hydrated and it can be managed. Like I said, it will all be dry heat in May. So you won't be swamped in humidity at least. 
 And limit your time outdoors too. Never stay for long under direct sunlight. Try to either stay indoors (preferably in AC) or under shade if you're outdoors.

 I mean, the max temperature in some of the places on your list is gonna be more than 45 degrees in May. Might even touch 50 degrees. You do the Maths according to your tolerance.  
 I was talking about staying under shade mostly because sunlight is unrelenting in these places in summer. UV attack on your skin is gonna be brutal if your skin lacks melanin.

A province of 127+ million people has handled 450+mm of rain along with 1.2m+ cusecs of floodwaters effectively so that 1.2m people have been successfully evacuated and less than 35 deaths have occurred, many of which were rescue workers. What should we compare Punjab government’s disaster response to? 243 people died during the 2021 European floods because of only 300mm rain. Floods in Texas this year killed more than 135 people because of ~300mm rain. The affected countries/states were far, far richer than us and nothing could prevent the flooding. 
 OP, this is a genuine question for you and all those who harbour similar views:  
 When the CM was in Lahore, coordinating rescue operations behind the scenes, people complained that she is absent.

Reddit,I owe an apology to all the women living in Pakistan,Artistic-4356,"I really don't like generalizing or using phrases like ""all men"", but the way boys are brought up in Pakistan and the things culture have taught them is so crazy.

Reddit,I owe an apology to all the women living in Pakistan,Artistic-4356,"Its the scientific inaccuracy thats actually scary. The problem is not preferring virgin, it's more the test of virginity a lot of people have in their mind that's inaccurate. The prevalent idea is that there should be visible bleeding when the ""seal"" breaks and when that does not happen women can and do get in serious trouble even if they are being truthful. A lot of men have ideas about how to detect virginity and it just doesn't work that way. For example, I've heard people say if a woman is too comfortable, or not shy enough it raises doubts. Guys who say phrases like ""no seal no deal"" and put a lot of focus on ""seal"" can become a nightmare for the woman even if she is a virgin because he will likely start doing virginity tests on her and hyperanalyzing her behaviour, she may end up divorced or accussed if she doesn't pass the test. I see some guys making jokes about the 'cycle theory"", referring to the hymen breaking without the woman doing anything of that sort.

Reddit,I owe an apology to all the women living in Pakistan,Eepybeany,"Its not about being shallow. I’m not talking about men who have prior sexual experiences. Im talking about men who are virgins themselves. How is mutually being your partner’s one and only being shallow? The virginity as the appeal is not what I’m talking about at all and you grossly misconstrued my words.  
 Just to be clear, if an ‘experienced’ man has this experience, then he’s shallow and hypocritical. I think I made that clear already but apparently you missed it in your graphic detailing of intercourse.  
 And by saying that virgin men are allowed to have the preference of a virgin wife doesn’t mean that all women who aren’t virgins are unclean. I’m absolutely against that mindset. Women can do whatever they want but men, who do control themselves, can care about their partner’s past. Most men in Pakistan are Muslims and being one means that most do not act on their desires. Most women don’t either, mind you. 
 That being said, there is a large portion of virgin men in Pakistan, who think that a virgin wife is their God given right. What I mean by that is they think that if a woman does engage in premarital sex, she has to disclose it to them before marriage even though Islam allows the women to hide their sins and as long as the woman intends to be faithful after marriage she’s well within her rights to hide her past at the time of marriage. Most Pakistani and Muslim men in general denounce this is as if its an unforgivable sin even though a woman having premarital sex is a sin to God, not you.  
 Unfortunately if the woman does disclose her past, most men, perhaps even myself, will not marry her. Maybe she’s reformed (for lack of a better word), but the guy is allowed to have a preference. This preference is as shallow as wanting a beautiful face or tall stature or even money. You’re allowed to have them. Denouncing those who do not have this preference and act on their desires lack of it is abhorrent behavior.",3,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1poo6tx/i_owe_an_apology_to_all_the_women_living_in/
Reddit,I owe an apology to all the women living in Pakistan,Eepybeany,"If you’re Muslim you aren’t supposed to have premarital sex. I don’t see people who do have premarital sex as inferior, but i do think that someone who indulges in these acts does not hold the same values as me. Or at least they once didn’t so I can’t be sure about them now. If you’re not Muslim, I can’t make you understand.  
 And its not just men who want a one and only. Muslim women also feel the same way. How is this shallow you failed to explain. Why is it narcissistic to be each other’s only? If you want to have sex and fulfill your desires then go ahead. 
 A man having premarital sex but condemning it in women means that he doesn’t hold any such values and instead holds a preference due to the power dynamic you described that you seem to have forgotten. When two people are in the same situation, they are on level terms. Don’t you agree? So when one has an advantage of previous experience, there is a certain power dynamic. I called people who prefer this power dynamic, who prefer virgins to “take their virginity” purely out of that desire rather than any values (like abstaining from premarital sex) to be shallow. If you think this is making up rules and not a consistent narrative, I don’t know what to say to you. Can’t make a fish fly, now can you?  
 Im talking about it from a Muslim standpoint. Any cultural bias that is there, I’m unaware of it because guess what, being Muslim has meant that most men around me don’t have pre marital sex, or at least don’t tell other about it. From this point of view, and from living in a 99% Muslim country, I am sorry to say, this is going to be how interpret things. Maybe its a failing on my part, but this is all I have ever known. So of course I’m going to think religion is a factor, especially because my interactions with Arab men on the internet have brought me to the same conclusions. I don’t know if you have had the opportunity to engage with so many different religions on this topic, but I haven’t.  
 Why does a woman need to hide pre marital sex in a Muslim society? Because she’s in a Muslim society and any practicing woman and man stays away from this. Meaning its a sin. And you’re supposed to hide your sins. Marital sex is not a sin. So equating marrying a divorcee to a woman who has had extra marital relationships is disingenuous. I have no problem with marrying a divorcee if the stars align so to say. Its not the action for me but rather what it tells about the person that’s the problem for me.  
 Having said that, this is not the case for most Pakistani men. Like I said they want a virgin wife as if its their God given right. The Prophet married multiple divorcees and encouraged Muslim men to do the same during his time as well, because guess what, even then men wanted to marry virgins. This mindset is extremely toxic though and has to be changed. I cannot offer a method to so because I don’t know.  
 If you ask a practicing Muslim woman who hasn’t had pre marital sex in Pakistan, whether she would marry a virgin or one who’s not, guess who she will prefer if they’re equal in other areas? In Pakistan, its definitely a religion thing too.  
 I get the inkling you’re not a Muslim. If you bothered to read this essay answer which must be pretty difficult for you i guess judging from your level of reading comprehension, then maybe don’t talk about things you don’t know. From a Muslim point of view, leaving a life of sins defined by the religion is called reformation. And lmao. How is my not marrying a non-practicing Muslim woman bigotry?

Ik almost everywhere’s bad, but it’s very bad in Pakistan. Wives get thrown in kitchen (even if the husband loves her) and expected to cook like a robot for huge family dinners. Ik people who specifically got their sons married to mbbs degree holders, but after marriage were thrown in the kitchen as maids. Yes, there are women who love doing this, and I also want a woman who provides food to me when I provide sustenance to her, but I’m just saying, people marry their sons to degree holders and expect them to be the maid of the house. Then there’s this joint family system, house politics, in laws, the parents of the husband using the wife as their maid, like bro you’re not her parent, and there’s no Islamic obligation or anything for wives to work for the in laws. My sisters do hijab and abaya and all, and still men stare at them, but it’s less than women who don’t cover themselves up, and it’s their choice to wear whatever they want, as a man, my job is to not look at them. I don’t want gargoyles ogling my sisters, so I don’t do the same to other women.
And we don’t even know what happens were women in rural areas. My father once had a construction site near Muzaffergarh, and when he went to hire labour, only women were available, men stayed at home and women were forced to work in 45 degrees laying asphalt and shit. No one cares about their rights…
When it comes to marrying rights, women aren’t really given the authority to consent, they’re just asked “is he good looking?” And that’s enough… ik women who stay their whole lives in a house, in only girls school, they won’t have the experience to judge their life partner, but still…
Ik many cases in my own family where at some point of the wife’s life, she wanted a divorce and didn’t want to live with the person she was married to for several different reasons, but were pressured by her family to not do it or they will disown her, the reason? “He’s financially stable”
Like what?
When it comes to driving, women get ridiculed, get weird remarks and harsh looks. I’m happy that traffic wardens show leniency towards them…

I’d assume they’re British Pakistanis - what negative stereotypes are there about Mirpuris in Pakistan? I go to Pak regularly, and no one there  talks about Mirpuris at all, I’m sure it’s only ever British Pakistanis. 
 I am a British Pakistani, 1st gen born to Punjabi parents - I have a lot of Mirpuri friends, mosques that I go to etc and tbh it feels like we are practically the same people with slight differences in dialect.  
 British Pakistanis get a lot of stick in UK media for things like dangerous driving, drugs, grooming gangs, extremism and some people instead of defending all of us including Mirpuris try and blame Mirpuris for our poor reputation which is wrong. Because UK Pakistanis from across Pakistan are involved in the crime not just Mirpuris, and cousin marriages happen everywhere in Pak. 
 That stuff about the head shape is very confusing 😂 - never heard of that. 
 Some Pakistanis in UK will look down on Mirpuris because they dislike all poorer/less educated people and perceive Mirpuris to be like that, which is a baseless generalisation.  
 And tbh I experienced some similar things with Mirpuris - I met 2 (gen z Uk Mirpuris who aren’t fully aware of their heritage and culture) that seemed to think that they weren’t like me at all, completely different and almost superior where I was a Punjabi and they were ‘Kashmiri’. I asked him what language he spoke and he said ‘Kashmiri’ which obviously isn’t true. And I, like you, got on very well with Sikhs. 
 I’ve seen people from Pakistan say that British Pakistanis (that includes me, you, all Mirpuris and others) are more religious, some say it like it’s a bad thing which is weird. 
 Never be afraid to show your heritage, and don’t at all think that you can’t say you’re Pakistani.

Reddit,“You don’t look like you’re from Mirpur”,Uncle_Adeel,"Thank you for your comment, my flatmates are British Pakistanis either children of 1st gen migrants or 2nd gens. The thing is that people tend to believe here that when a person commits a crime it's due to their ethnicity rather than the conditions they were raised up in. It's proven that people growing up in poverty are more likely to commit crimes of varying natures. Due to Mirpuris being Brough over for work in reconstruction and textiles in the UK, once that went with Thatcher a lot lost their jobs and became unemployed- a Detroit of the UK. People went to crime not because of their race or their ethnicity, rather for the conditions they were raised in. To reiterate, not all who grow up poor will commit crime, rather poverty is a considerable factor in criminality. 
 Yeah I found the head shape thing weird, thing is multiple people have said I ""don't look mirpuri"", just that specific person explained it through head shape oddly enough. 
 I do feel like the increasing separation of people hailing from mirpur in AJK from the rest of Pakistan is a multifaceted issue but one considerable factor is the initial othering by people hailing from the rest of Pakistan. So in a sense they feel emboldened to embrace this identity due to them not being perceived as welcome. 
 A good example is when I was with my friends in an uber we chatted with the driver who was Pakistani, one of us asked him where he was from and he said ""azad Kashmir"", and one of us said ""Mirpur then?"", he then sighed and said ""yes"". Isn't that sad? A good, hardworking man having to be ashamed of where his ancestors were from due to discrimination from compatriots. 
 if you were to look at the other comment in this post it's evident that it's basically necessary obscuring my half Mirpuri identity lest I be seen as one of the cocaine-fuelled tramps that they believe mirpuris to be. The issue is that I don't want to be seen as inferior as a default, I want to be seen as an equal to everyone else, not superior.

 Not sure I agree with your point about rest of the Pakistanis not accepting ppl from AJK bc no one in Pak is like that, and how are people born and raised in Mirpur or other parts of AJK going to know that there a small group of British Pakistani punjabis that think they’re weird? I think it’s more to do with other reasons, like the fact that AJK (on the international stage at least) can’t be considered part of Pakistan like Punjab, KPK etc bc of dispute with India. Which alienates them slightly. But biggest reason is Pakistans military establishment’s actions has led to people across Pak to hate the government, which also extends to AJK hating Pak government. The shitty economic and political state of Pakistan leads to more people from AJK disliking Pak. As for my 2 friends that thought they were ‘Kashmiri’ I think it’s just that they were unaware of their true culture which is understandable given they are 3rd gen immigrants. 
 I feel like you may be reading too deep into that taxi driver - driving taxis is a long job, they’re tired all the time. He was probably just knackered.  
 And if you’re unhappy about the first comment from the guy who lived in Mirpur, imo he’s just talking about behaviour he’s observed from British Mirpuris that visit Pk, he’s even says that he knows many of them that are good but some aren’t which is the reality for British Pakistanis (regardless of where in Pak they’re from) and all ethnicities in any country across the world.

Reddit,“You don’t look like you’re from Mirpur”,fighting14,"This is a very intresting post. 
 I'm from AJK, but not from Mirpur or Kotli, but have lived around mirpuris for decades in the UK. 
 So I can see this phenomenon of how Mirpuris are perceived and how they actually are. 
 When the Mirpuris diaspora originally came to the UK they were a very unique case. Because they were granted immigration status to the UK because the UK needed manual laborers. The Pakistan government nominated Mirpuris as overseas workers to help compensate them for loss of lands and livelihoods due to the mangla dam construction. 
 So what essentially happened was tens of thousands of mirpuris who weren't particularly educated or worldly wise ended up in the UK. Some of these people hadn't even been to a major city in Pakistan (some hadn't even been to Mirpur proper!) , but we're overnight catapulted into London, Manchester, Bradford and Leeds to work in factories. 
 You can take the Mirpuris out of Mirpur, but you can't take Mirpur out of the Mirpuri diaspora. By that I mean all these people got industrious in the UK and built new lives businesses etc, but they never forgot their petty jealousies and biradrisms from the home land. 
 Mirpuris bought a very particular neich culture to the UK and protected it fiercely, unlike other migrant communities they didn't assimilate easily, preferring their own ways, rooted in rural outlooks on life, I'm not criticizing here, just being objective. 
 Mirpuris are industrious and hard working in the UK. But at the same time they didn't come from very educated stock on the whole and they have been slow to break out of narrow biradary based outlook on life. If Someone's goat eats the wheat in someone else's field in a village in Mirpur, then whole families have a falling out in the UK over this petty matter. That's how stupidly insular they can be. 
 Together with one upping one and other to project an image of wealth back in Mirpur, they build huge elaborate houses to out do each other. Majority of these houses stand empty for 11 months a year, whilst they might be occupied for one month when they come and visit. 
 Having said all this OP, what you must realise is that the 2nd and third generation Mirpuris are changing away from this stereotype in the UK, they are educated and more cosmopolitan in their outlook in life. But old stereotypes are hard to beat. 
 US Pakistani's often look down on UK Pakistanis, I've seen on this sub because of Mirpuri stereotypes. And they aren't entirely wrong. What you must remember is that's to emigrate to the US you typically needed to be a professional of some sort or educated and privileged to begin with. The Mirpuri diaspora were typically poorly educated farmers that found themselves in the UK overnight in large numbers and generally lived in isolated communities in the UK, so it's taken them longer to assimilate and really fit in.",6,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1otfaaj/you_dont_look_like_youre_from_mirpur/
Reddit,“You don’t look like you’re from Mirpur”,Uncle_Adeel,"In regards to economic status of British Pakistanis there’s a very good and valid explanation for such. 
 When they came over to aid in the reconstruction of the UK post WW2 they were funnelled into industrial sector jobs- working the factory lines, textiles, building, machinery and so on. That’s why the majority of British Pakistanis are concentrated in a few cities such as Sheffield, Bradford, Birmingham- essentially areas of high industrial output. At the same time they faced considerable discrimination so moving up the ranks to say wouldn’t be possible for at least 30 years. Then come to the 80’s, with Thatchers policies of deindustrialisation, the north got hit very hard. With the industrial sectors being essentially destroyed, factories closed and the workers went unemployed. That’s why if you were to ask a northerner in the UK what they think about Thatcher you won’t get much gratitude. This naturally hit British Pakistanis hard, who weren’t as well distributed across the UK as other groups and as such were disproportionately affected as they were initially funnelled into the industrial sectors. This happened just over 40 years ago. Given the policy of the UK, investment was funnelled towards London while the north was neglected. So the British Pakistanis stayed unemployed, not out of laziness but due to government failings to adequately support their own citizens after destroying their livelihoods. Those who made it out did so before thatcher came to power, those who didn’t struggled. Only recently (my generation) could such injustices be undone. As a result, British Pakistanis are statistically more likely to have a university degree, be in university, and have similar rates of not being a NEET (not employed, in education or training) compared to white British and on average. 
 As we know, poverty and unemployment has a bunch of residual effects (higher rates of crime, lower life expectancy, etc).  
 So no it’s not due to a lack of willingness to integrate.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1otfaaj/you_dont_look_like_youre_from_mirpur/
Reddit,“You don’t look like you’re from Mirpur”,kernal_di_biwi,"The points you make are valid. However the fact that even after all this time UK Pakistanis face such a low socio economic standing means that the inertia for change was high. The assimilation that should have been done within 1-2 generations is still lagging (e.g. such high number of cousin marriages in this day and age, being a net drain on the health care system) it's a positive sign that more of them are getting educated, but education alone is not the full picture.  
 You can look across the atlantic and see how well US based Pakistanis have done in much shorter time and are over represented in high value industries. Yes, being more educated has played a part but I would argue not belonging to a dominant ethnic community helped them in stepping out of their comfort zones and adapt.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1otfaaj/you_dont_look_like_youre_from_mirpur/
Reddit,“You don’t look like you’re from Mirpur”,Encrypted-Warrior,"As a person from Mirpur, living in Mirpur for a long time, there is something I'd like to share which u might be interested in. British Mirpuris can be the most shittiest people when in Pakistani. I'll give some examples,    
 
 They act like they're superior, talking shit to shop/establishment staff like they're some 3rd class servants. I've heard literal cursing. 
 They drive cars like a monkey on coca1ne and when a person gets killed they silence them with money or force. If you see a Prado going 100km/h in the center of Mirpur cutting off cars and people you're sure to see a british mirpuri inside. 
 They love to flex the british accent around even with their relatives who don't speak much of it. 
 Shorts are not a bad thing imo but respecting a citys cultural preference is a thing. People here do wear shorts but below the knee for religious reasons, British mirpuris love to wear boxer sized shorts in public. 
and more 
 
 Now, I am not saying everyone is like this, I have seen many respectful British Mirpuris visiting, I have some distant family in the UK as well, and they are not like this at all. But majority are, so the thing being associated to you has some real background to it.  
 I have not visited UK, but I think these people also act like this abroad ruining our image, but then the word going around is that they are really good citizens abroad, they just abuse the lack of law enforcement here in Pakistan/Mirpur.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1otfaaj/you_dont_look_like_youre_from_mirpur/
Reddit,“You don’t look like you’re from Mirpur”,Uncle_Adeel,"So a question is this, is the aforementioned experiences due to the people coming from a poor background in the UK (as such they bring the usual poor etiquette that is attached with such socio-economic labels, it's a fact that people from lower socio-economic backgrounds tend to swear more, commit more crimes etc) or an inherent trait of people hailing from Mirpur? 
 I don't know how you're getting all of these examples, I'm interested in how you experienced such events. I find it questionable that you believe the majority of Mirpuris act this way, is this not a hasty generalisation. For each person who speeds you can find numerous who don't speed, but you don't consider that as they don't nearly cross your mind as much as those who speed.  
 When I spent a few months in Pakistan I spent most of my time in Muzaffarabad, for the time that I was in Mirpur I did see speeding yes, but everything else I didn't see at all. Does this mean UK mirpuris are all well behaved and essentially ghosts? It's your word against mine and a dozen others.  
 I think I can come to make a good comparison. In the UK a cheap holiday abroad is Spain, especially a place called Benidorm. Let's just say they do not have a good reputation at all. As it's cheap you can attract monkeys who act very rude and inappropriate because frankly people from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to behave rudely due to the environment they grew up in being more hostile and other things. Compare it to New York, which is quite expensive to travel, more affluent people can travel there and they behave well due to socio-economic factors (richer people are more likely to behave well comparatively to poor people, richer in this sense can even just mean lower middle or middle class which constitutes the majority of the UK). It's akin to a working class (fairly poor) Pakistani being able to go on holiday to a city in china. You can see how that goes. 
 When it comes to supposed Kashmir supremacy, I have no idea where that comes from. Maybe a colourist belief in the sense of they believe they are more likely to descend from foreign invaders and be supposedly lighter? I mean I haven't seen such a thing in the UK, rather the opposite. 
 I think the crux of the issue is that the people who come to Pakistan are frankly on the lower end of the socio-economic scale and as such they bring all of the associated etiquettes, language, manners and all. Rather than that being a trait inherent to specifically Mirpuris. I know a Karachi in the UK who stabbed someone, got stabbed, deals drugs and got a white girl pregnant before the age of 16. He's the only Karachiwala I know, therefore making up an absolute majority. I don't believe all of them are inherently debased as a people. As well as a Lahori who got married behind their parents back to a person over a zoom call. I know a Mirpuri who has gone to jail for robbery.  
 You know what's the similarity between them all? They come from poverty.",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1otfaaj/you_dont_look_like_youre_from_mirpur/
Reddit,“You don’t look like you’re from Mirpur”,Encrypted-Warrior,"I did not say it was an inherent trait of people from Mirpur, I mentioned why Mirpuris might be flagged as so... i.e the reason behind it. Offcourse, not all fingers are the same and you do have a point that peaceful people are not noticeable. But here's the thing, my observation which made me say 'majority' isn't just from seeing speeding cars on the roads. 
 You mentioned lower socio-economic backgrounds in UK, well interestingly the brit mirpuris that behave like idiots here are mostly from the villages which are quite close to the city, one or two connected to the city. I myself have spent a few years in a village. Whenever there is a family event and at the start of winter (I don't remember months exactly, i moved to the city long time ago), a lot of Mirpuris from the UK come to visit, and that's where the majority comes from. If you only see the cities I.e Mirpur, Dadyal, the number isn't that high, but considering the literal tens of if not hundreds of small villages surrounding the cities, it becomes a majority.  
 Muzaffarabad doesn't have a lot of people abroad afaik. Mirpur is just crazy, you can ask anyone who is from Mirpur and they'll have distant or immediate family in UK. Offcourse there are exceptional cases but trust me, I can count on my fingers the number of people I've come accross who are from Mirpur and don't have any family abroad. 
 Well my take on the supremacy thing is the opposite actually. The people who go abroad from the villages and then come back to visit act like they are superior, not a Kashmir supremacy (Or else everyone here would act this way when they go to let's say Islamabad or something).   
 You are on point in the second last paragraph, people who are literate and are from literate and sensible backgrounds aren't like this even if they go across the globe.  
 I personally think it's an inferiority complex when they are here, in villages. And when they come back they think they've witnessed something no one else here can (stupid), so they behave like bosses while looking like utter idiots.

Reddit,"Suzuki Alto airbags didn’t deploy, got pushed by police to start the car — what a day in Lahore",GoodmanWideAwake,"Defensive Driving: A Cultural Necessity for Pakistani Roads 
 The core issue isn't just physics - it's culture. When you brake, they crash because tailgating isn't an accident in Pakistan; it's a lifestyle. 
 Driving schools? Mythical.
Licenses? Adopted/Bought, not earned.
Stopping distance? ""Insha'Allah"" isn't a safety metric. 
 The Reality: Control What You Can
You can't stop reckless drivers, but defensive driving saves lives. Here's proof from Pakistan's roads: 
 Scenario 1: The Tailgating Chain Reaction
Location: Lahore's MM Alam Road, rush hour
Incident: A sedan brakes suddenly for a pedestrian. The car behind (1 car length away) causes a 4-vehicle pileup. 
 How Defensive Driving Helps:
1. Mirror Checks (every 8 sec): Would have revealed the tailgating SUV earlier.
2. Escape Route: Moving right when first threatened prevents becoming the ""meat sandwich.""
3. Buffer Zone: The only unscathed vehicle was a motorcyclist maintaining a 3-second gap. 
 Cultural Truth: The at-fault driver obtained his license through ""references."" 
 Scenario 2: The Reckless Overtaker
Location: Karachi's Shahrah-e-Faisal
Incident: A minibus swerves violently into the right lane, forcing emergency braking. 
 Defensive Success:
- Alert driver noticed erratic behavior 200m back
- Maintained 4-second gap (vs standard 2)
- Pre-identified shoulder as escape route
Result: Minimal braking, no collision. 
 Systemic Failure: The minibus's ""Professional Driver"" decal mocked a system where PSV licenses are sold. 
 By the Numbers
1. 78% of rear-end collisions involve improperly licensed drivers (NH&MP 2023)
2. 60% fewer sudden brakes when maintaining 3-second gaps (Urban Traffic Studies)
3. UK ambulance drivers change lanes 3x more than Pakistanis to keep buffers - exactly what's needed here. 
 Why Pakistan Resists Safe Driving
1. Ego: Lane changes seen as ""losing face""
2. Fatalism: ""Insha'Allah"" replaces physics - 92% brake too late (video analysis) 
 What Works
- Mirror checks (5-8 sec): Matches NATO's 7-second hazard standard
- Escape planning: Reduces collision risk by 40% (Asian studies) 
 The Hard Truth
Road construction has increased 300% since 2000, yet accidents per km rose 175%. More roads + zero education = expanded chaos. 
 Final Word
These aren't theories - they're survival tactics. With Pakistan's traffic death rate 3x global average (WHO), defensive driving is the thin line between survival and becoming a statistic.

 I’m not pretending that my experience is universal. Only applies to the ones I know. 
 Most of the people I know who went opt and/or h1b left the country. Most just didn’t like the lifestyle here, missed the city living / foods / culture in China. Lots of FOMO seeing life in China on social media but stuck in boring suburbs in the US. Some worked here for a while and got better jobs at chinese tech companies.  
 Covid was the big nail in the coffin though, alot of  remaining h1b I know left during covid cuz they were disgusted by how the US was handling things. Ironically, into the lions den as later china started having draconian lockdowns. 
 I’d say about 5/30 h1b/opt I knew since 2016 are still in US now.

 There are also areas of cities that have a more local feel in the sense that many residents are locals, the businesses are independent, food is more authentic and often cheaper.

On the way home, I stopped at an authentic local pharmacy to pick up some medication for a head cold. Tomorrow, I need to schedule a dentist appointment, do a load of laundry, and probably watch some Netflix. 
 If you're a tourist in my city and want to get an authentic, genuine, local experience doing these things, then I guess you can follow me around for a day.

 Every polish person knows Wroclaw. But not many people outside of Poland know it and it’s a beautiful place. So speaking to someone from another country I find it an accurate description - it is a “hidden gem” in a sense that not a lot of Europeans go there. Is it free if tourists? No, but it’s free of European tourists. 
 Then take a step further. Majority of Europeans heard about Cracow but a lot of people from outside of Europe didn’t. Then speaking to someone from Europe I wouldn’t say Cracow is “a hidden gem” but if I write on a travel forum eg for Americans visiting Europe then yes, it is a hidden gem because majority of the people there do not include it in their itinerary. Again, this doesn’t mean the city is not touristy.

 Not really, have not been there for a long time, but nowadays loads of low cost carrier flights go there from all over Europe. I'm pretty sure those flights are not entirely packed with Polish people that explore Europe.  
 But does it really matter where the tourists come from? Whether they are Polish, Italian, American or Chinese, a place receiving lots of tourists comes with downsides. In my mind somebody looking for hidden gems and certainly for off the beaten track places is looking for places that do not have those downsides. They are looking for places without crowds, places with hardly any tourism or at least no large scale tourism.  
 
 So yeah if you are so well travelled and geography is your hobby then nothing is a hidden gem anymore 
 
 Plenty of hidden gems exist, nobody knows all the picturesque little towns and villages, there are many thousands. All of Europe is dotted with them. Asia has shitloads of them too and Africa and Latin America have a good number too. All people have to do to discover them is to just get out of the cities and off the highways and 'wander' around.  
 We can of course play around with definitions, but reality is that most people, even that ask for them, don't really want or don't dare to go off the beaten track. They want a list of 'approved' hidden gems and off the beaten track destinations. The exact opposite of hidden gems and off the beaten track. They just want a safely predictable trip, where other people have done the legwork of describing and documenting the places. The way I look at it for most asking these are just buzz words just like 'authentic' 'travel as a local' 'local experiences' etc. If not meaningless rhetoric, most are not willing to do the legwork required.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1orompf/can_we_all_just_stop_being_obsessed_with_all_this/

 But is it really? I guess the operative word here is 'some', it may be hard to find places that attract absolutely zero tourists, specially in Europe. But there are loads of places that see very few. They may in one way or another be a tier lower than the more crowded ones, but they can be interesting nevertheless and provide a completely different experience. Not every little town in Germany with half timbered houses or a castle, not every old little village in Italy is flooded by locals. There are simply too many of them! The only thing one has to do is to get out there and to explore to discover them. 
 Somebody asking for hidden gems and off the beaten track places is imho not looking for places that are flooded with tourists no matter whether they are local or international. But there is of course a difference between a nice lively town and a crowded one and locally popular places may still qualify as those tend to be frequented during the weekends or as day trips, so if one visits on a week day, stays the night it may still feel off beat, though some also feel soulless like many of the popular beach towns in winter.  
 In the end it is not black & white, but the point is that imho the underlying premise of asking for hidden gems and off beat destinations is avoiding crowds. Pointing them to places they likely don't know based on their nationality that are crowded with people from other nationalities does meet the goal an off beat experience.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1orompf/can_we_all_just_stop_being_obsessed_with_all_this/

 With that definition about everywhere is hidden, maybe with the exception of the true top destinations. All nationalities have their own favorite countries and places. If you don't do research, not even open a travel guide, everything remains hidden.  
 
 What’s an example of a hidden gem in your opinion? 
 
 I don't have an example as I find the term problematic. What is hidden depends on your research and what is considered a gem is highly subjective. As such I prefer the off the beaten path terminology (which of course comes with its own issues). Fact is that when I go cycle touring I encounter loads of beautiful and interesting places with very few if any tourists. The only thing you have to do is get out of big cities and away of the highways and explore. Italy is dotted with picturesque crumbling villages, Germany is full of towns with half timbered houses, China has loads of quaint villages, France is full of beautiful castles. I just stumble upon them, enjoy them and move on, I don't keep track of them.  
 Reality is that many places are far from hidden and still not overly busy. They are described in every serious travel guide. Wroclaw, you mentioned, may be an example of that. Have long not been there, based on your description and the number of low cost flights going there nowadays, it may very well have changed but I remember it as a lively city, not a very touristy one. Recently hiked the Hanseatic city trail, non of the Hanseatic cities were busy with tourists when I passed through more lively (with mostly locals) some even fairly quiet. This despite several of them well described for everybody willing to open a decent travel guide to the Netherlands. So I don't see how anyone serious could consider them hidden. But for those interested in such cities they are absolutely gems. And as most tourists from further afield tend to stick to the larger cities in the west, they are at least moderately off the beaten track.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1orompf/can_we_all_just_stop_being_obsessed_with_all_this/

 The entire concept is based on comparison to others not on that place’s impact on you.

Their behaviour ranges from mildly amusing to extremely annoying. Some of the privileged southeast asian ethos is bragging rights for reaching an “exclusive” destination (think Europe, North America, usually for the gram), while the western tourists (not all) gets pretty judgy with your travel choices and locations (oh man you should’ve gone to  insert name  instead of  insert name of mainstream place while talking over everyone else  scoff scoff).

Reddit,What’s the Most Jaw-Dropping Hike You’ve Ever Done?,daniwelllived,"I think it really comes down to personal preference tbh  
 In terms of the shuttle, dealing with flights was way more complicated than the shuttle, it's as straight forward as booking the shuttle and they drop you at the trailhead. Didn't really add any complications or take away from the trip, and it's just the one shuttle if you do R2R. But also,.pretty much any hike on this thread takes some level of planning and travel logistics.  
 The rims are different, yeah. Maybe not in any worldview shifting ways, but different for sure. The north rim was quieter, I could count on my hand the number of people I saw (campgrounds / trailhead excluded). I didn't see anyone at all for 12 of the ~15ish miles between Cottonwood and Phantom Ranch, but after Phantom Ranch all the way to the Bright Angel trailhead, I was never alone. I enjoyed having the canyon to myself, that's something that I would not have experienced if I only did stuff on the south rim. But I did also enjoy getting to meet people from all over the world on the south rim, and I would have missed out on that if I only did the north rim. The north rim also has a higher elevation, and the highest point in the park is on the north rim (another hobby of mine). Views are different. I was recently back at GCNP, taking an elderly family member on a bucket list trip, and I did feel like I was missing out on something just doing the south rim, but that could easily be because I already did both.  
 TL;DR: whatever floats your boat & if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I really enjoyed the R2R, but you seem to be enjoying your method and that's just fine too",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1ol54wx/whats_the_most_jawdropping_hike_youve_ever_done/

1. Confirm their affiliation with Saudi authorities by checking their license number.
2. Confirming your flight date, time and booking. The airlines follow military time, meaning it's 1300 for 1 pm noon. 
3. If you end up in a bad hotel, you can do anything about it. But you can request a room change. Sometimes they accommodate you. 
4.

 Have you thought about maybe adopting where you live it is a great burden to bear also for adopting an orphan.  
 There is usually great difficulty in the adoption of ethnic minority kids in western nations due to lack of takers unfortunately due to the stigma in Asian/Muslim societies over adoption.

 I would suggest if you have the means, then to contact a good lawyer who specialises in this, you can dm me, I might be able to help with that.

Hearing you talk about your early morning schedule actually made me feel like I was stressing over nothing haha  
 But yeah I totally agree with everything you said regarding how you use your time.

 I think, once you emit that kind of sober energy you somehow end up being in the same orbit as other non drinkers. If you are patient, and do not have any age restriction while hanging out, you can definitely have fun.
If your preferred age bracket is early 20s or 30s then chances are - YOU will find more drinking energy at hostels coz all the other sober ones are generally staying in more calm places, privates.

I’ve been not drinking since I’m 18. And I’ve been out partying and dancing. But especially at uni this had been tough as people tried to push me to drink. Or wouldn’t believe I can go dancing even tho I don’t drink. So I know the struggle. It helped me to have a staple non-alcoholic drink i really like so I wouldn’t have to think about it. For me it was ginger ale. And after going out once or twice people would know it’s ’my’ drink. 
I’ve been solo travelling a bit as well. When couch surfing was not behind a paywall I met people this way! I would meet so many cool people and I am still in contact with some of them- they live all over so meeting again is hard sometimes. They also had meet and greets in cities.  
 The first time I went solo travelling I met a guy, he was with a big group and actually annoying me as I wanted peace and quiet. We ended up having a chat, realised that we had a similar itinerary, so we agreed to meet up in the next city again. 3 years later we had stayed in contact and met once in a while and more and more often. Till we realised we do like each other a lot more ;)  
 Depending on the style of travel ( how fast you want to go through these countries) a volunteer for board and food position (websites like woofing or Workaway) can also help to meet other people from all over the world. 
In the cities I also agree with the others: hostels, free walking tours or there is a couple of apps where you can book ‘experiences’. I have never used it but an acquaintance, I met on a flight and I stayed with used that a lot. She went to a cooking class and an art get together. 
In the last year i have been super lucky in meeting people having breakfast or dinner at a hostel. Sometimes I would initiate and ask if they have recommendations. Often a conversation appeared naturally. Or there were people having a chat and I could help with a question so I’d chime in. It felt a bit like I am ‘attracting’ the kind of people I want to meet. Like that kind that doesn’t  want to party hard core either. There are more out there than you think ;)  
 Another thing you could try is Hostasister it’s a fb page and it’s from girls for girls. You can write beforehand and either people from that city or other travellers can reply and you can organise a meet up or a stay too. I haven’t tried it but I’ve seen so many success stories :)",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pdf5go/sober_solo_traveler_how_to_meet_people_without/

Reddit,Flashback from our trip to Japan this summer - Osaka and Kyoto,saltedcaramellll,"Same here. I’m from a tropical, hot, and humid country haha. Happy to see that you’ve already planned ahead. Good move! I’d add a few things from my personal experience. 
 
 Prepare water to carry with you. Electrolyte water is a big plus to compensate for fluids lost through sweating and in case you get sunstroke. 
 Big hats and umbrellas do help. They can prevent headaches when walking for a long time under the sun. 
 Bring any kind of fan. 
 
 About the Gion Matsuri: I did see it and found it pretty interesting. We still enjoyed it a lot. Not only tourists but also locals were excited, so the atmosphere was great. It would be even better if you could find a way to understand the meaning behind the event. The procession was quite long and consisted of multiple “parts.” We wanted to avoid the crowd at the starting point (the shrine), so we tracked the route and waited for the procession to pass our spot. 
 There were fireworks too, but unfortunately we chose the wrong viewing area, so all we could do was hear the fireworks. I looked this up on a Japanese website, so you might want to double-check the information.

 I have a Zoleo and the satellite texting reliability is excellent. My use case when backpacking is to only turn on my phone when I need to see the map, or if I have an emergency and need to text.

Reddit,Pakistani Security Forces Hunted and Killed Anti-Israel Protestors While Prime Minister Nominated Trump for Nobel Peace Prize,Purple_Persimmon_220,"I wanted to share a brief, factual overview 
 The Crane Party (T|L|P) has organized peaceful protests since Oct 2023 — including 13 Oct, 5 Nov, 21 Nov 2023, and July 2024 at Faizabad. These gatherings demanded humanitarian aid for G|a|z|a, boycotts of I|s|r|a|e|l|i products, and diplomatic pressure for peace. 
 After one such protest, Pakistan’s government officially declared Benj**** Netan**** a “t|e|r|r|o|r|i|s|t” and agreed to boycott companies supporting Israel. Yet, despite signed agreements, later demonstrations were met with arrests and live fire — even though official permissions existed. 
 Now, context matters: Pakistan has recently recognized Israel under the two-state policy, and the authorities no longer want any domestic events opposing |I|s|r|a|e|l. This shift has also opened the door for anti-religious legislation — something that only the Crane Party had historically resisted — potentially benefiting secular groups and the Qadiani/Mirzai/Ahmadi community, which is declared non-Muslim by nearly all Islamic nations. 
 Many around the world remain unaware because mainstream media provided no coverage. Online platforms also suppress content — if you search this party’s name or its leaders, social media often warns or deletes posts.
If anyone wants proof, I can share screenshots and video evidence. 
 Right now, another major operation is expected against this party — and whenever such action happens, Pakistan’s internet is usually shut down. 
 False claims linking the Crane Party to Afghanistan are baseless. The party follows the Barelvi Sunni school, while the T|a|l|i|b|a|n are Deobandi — two different ideologies. 
 When both global powers and local regimes control media, truth becomes the first casualty. What’s happening isn’t confusion — it’s suppression.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1o8x763/pakistani_security_forces_hunted_and_killed/

Reddit,"I (a man) was grabbed by another man while sleeping, at Viajero Montevideo.

Best they can do most of the time is call the police and the police most of the time won't do anything either, especially if there's no injury or damage 
 They could technically trespass him, but if they know that he might cause trouble chances are they will choose not to, for their own safety as well 
 That still doesn't make it ok of course! But we live in a world where things work like this, the agressor often wins and being grabbed without injury or damage is viewed as almost being on the level of having an argument with someone. 
 That should change, but I don't think it will change on the individual level of how a hostel is run any time soon. The change will come from a broader shift in how we view bodily autonomy, respect and consent. 
 Twenty years ago I had a couple doing the deed in the bunk above me, they were still going when staff arrived... Best they could do was send the guy away by holding it over his head that if he didn't leave quietly they'd have to call the police and have his girl outside for the night as well.

 Every case is different; there’s a lot of devices around 150k that suit you good (I didn’t go for those because they didn’t meet my needs). 
 A lot of it depends on how advance the hearing loss is, how much socialisation does the person do, presence of tinnitus or other conditions, etc. Again, find a good consultant who will listen to you and not rip you off. 
 I wouldn’t suggest going for a Pakistani or a German brand - they are good on the pocket but aren’t as good in functionality or visual appeal. Since it’s something your mother will be using 24/7, try different companies before choosing one. From the research I did, I found Starkey to be the best option.

 As far as flying vs ferry+train from Penang to KL, the time difference isn't that much when you account for having to get to the airport early, deboarding and exiting the airport, traffic, etc. Door to door it might be about 4 hours to fly vs 5 with the ferry and train. As far as luggage goes, they've recently built an enclosed pedestrian passageway from the ferry terminal to the train station to it's similar to transferring between airport terminals, but it's still a 5-10 minute walk.

We wandered about the streets of Lahore, our pockets stuffed with pistachios. We popped them into our mouths one after another as we walked along, deep in conversation. Standing in a lane we gorged on fried fish. My appetite was wonderful. In the salubrious climate of Lahore, whatever one ate was digested easily. We entered a hotel. My mouth began to water at the sight of hot dogs and hamburgers. 
 We made the rounds of Anarkali and Shalimar, and saw Noor Jahan’s mausoleum. Then followed endless rounds of invitations, mushairas and gossip.
And suddenly, my heart sent up a thanksgiving prayer to the Crown of England for providing us this unique opportunity of enjoying ourselves in Lahore. I began to look forward eagerly to the second hearing. I did not even care if the verdict was that I be hanged. If it occurred in Lahore, I would certainly achieve the status of a martyr.

Cambodia is also on the list which is a great.plqce be wise you can easy fuck with visas in SEA.  
 Most of the Caribbean and vanatu are also on the list which means you could just hitch boats around islands as well.  
 If money is stopping you look into hostel work and work away so you can eliminate the money part from traveling all together.  
 You can also fuck off to Georgia a sue the visa policy there to get a passport and residency and the have more access. This will take time but it is possible. 
 I personally feel like sometimes you need to ask different questions. Like don't worry about why you can't leave or how hard that might be but rather worry about how you can make the goal happen. It's no different from hiking. You see a mountain and you wonder what's on the other side so you go and check.  
 Have you thought about looking into giving hiking tours to rich Pakistani / Russian people from outside Pakistan. For example hiking trips to Siberia and Patagonia.

 Based on your style of travel, a suitcase is totally fine - it allows for more storage, can be checked easily on planes without needing to go into oversized luggage, and you dont seem like you regularly need to change accomodations or modes of travel.

Reddit,"We are suitcase travellers, thinking to replace the suitcases with backpacks.",phflopti,"I have both a suitcase and a backpack. Generally speaking I tend to pack light: my bags are usually about 12 - 15 kg or less when I travel overseas.  
 I take the backpack when I know I will need to carry my bag rather than wheel a suitcase, for example when staying in more boutique / quirky / low budget / b&b style places that don't have lifts. For example, I was very glad not to be dragging a suitcase up a narrow windy set of stairs to a cute attic flat in Paris. 
 Also, wheeling is also only nice on super smooth surfaces. If I'm going to be walking to my accommodation from a train station, anywhere with cobblestone or gravel streets, steep streets, getting on & off boats, or making speedy transfers at train stations, I much prefer my backpack.

The biggest advantage appears to be flexibility - cobblestone streets, stairs in old buildings without elevators, hopping on local buses where there's no luggage space. Airlines treat them the same as suitcases size-wise, so no extra restrictions there. One thing that helped me decide was actually going through TravelGiftList when I was researching different backpack options - they had these detailed comparison guides that weren't trying to sell me anything, just breaking down what actually works for different travel styles. 
 For month-long stays like you're doing, I'd suggest getting something in the 40-50L range so you're not overpacking but have enough for different climates.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1ptpfof/we_are_suitcase_travellers_thinking_to_replace/

 You would just think about the activity itself. If there would be just 2-3 pictures, probably there wouldn't be noticed women are missing.

I know women in pakistan are getting education and slowly creating their own space and working towards their freedom. But the point I mentioned isn't far from reality. Many are stuck at home and even for something as basic as getting groceries, even if 5 women are in the house, a teen boy would be asked to get them simply because they either don't want the hassle of putting the full covering or they are told to let the men know if they need something. It's nothing wrong. But I'm sure there are millions of women who would like to simply be out and about without having to worry if they'll be told it's not good for women to be roaming around so much. While the women in bigger cities are more free, we hear many such tragic stories from the smaller cities and towns that tell a different story and I do remember a news about this little girl who was murdered by her parents in the west because she used to upload pictures or videos on tictoc.

Do the kids have choice as to whether their mother stays home to look after them or not? Are the kids happier if their mother works all day? 
 Compare this to the US, where 78% of women in the same age group work. It's not clear to me that they have any greater choice  not  to work than those in Pakistan have to work. In other words, I'd speculate that many of the women in the US are financially forced to work. Are they happy?

In egalitarian societies, there are sophisticated family friendly policies that do not diminish the effectiveness of the workforce(literally double the population is working). Both chores and childcare is shared by parents. So the children will be fine.
Secondly just cuz some women would not want to deal with financial stress doesn’t outweigh the natural human sentiment present equally in both genders to be autonomous and independent. Those women can date men who would want a traditional relationship. You don’t need to force it on the rest of society. Most people would naturally incline without the oppressive suppression of patriarchal cultures to egalitarianism, and equal contributions.

Reddit,First time traveling in Pakistan,marcog,"I revisit the question I asked above. What about the women forced to work to provide for their families? They have no choice. The matter of choice the comment I was replying to is a fallacy to these women. Western society favours one kind of woman, the one that wants to work. Islamic societies favour women who don't want to work. Can you not see that both are perfectly reasonable and can coexist on this planet? If a Pakistani woman really struggles in the mindset of her society, she can, and they often do, move. Just like I'd move to an Islamic society if I were to settle (I'm nomadic). 
 Saying that most people would incline to equal contributions, where does that come from? Probably your societal upbringing. Even hunter gather societies had distinctive roles. The women seldom went out hunting. 
 Anyways. The thing is, at the end of the day we Muslims follow the guidance from God. Non Muslims will always find reason to disagree with us. I was a non Muslim for most of my life.

Reddit,First time traveling in Pakistan,masharr,"ever heard of culture?  
 for example, putting a hand on ur friend's shoulder is frowned upon in the arab world. it doesn't matter how close you are. also, getting close to a stranger in the west to talk is seen as weird and creepy. but these two things are completely normal in South Asia. 
 coming to being pictured in public, there are two reasons i think. one being a developing country and less use of tech in day to day life. people here do not capture or record everything they see like in the west. it's only getting started here now. the youngsters capture and record most things, but still not as much as in the developed countries. therefore, getting pictured without consent might offend people here. it's not specific to women. men could also be offended if pictured without consent, as they would see you picturing them because there's something funny or wrong with them. it's like how pointing at a stranger in public is morally wrong, because it might make them anxious as to whether there's something wrong or funny with them. 
 the second reason is religion. but what you need to learn is that Islam isn't just a religion in Islamic countries. it's become their culture. the day to day life is dictated by it. so yeah, conservative women who cover themselves when they go out would really be offended if pictured without consent. 
 as i have mentioned in the earlier reply, it's not like the entire region is super conservative. the urban cities are mostly liberal as well as the northern parts of the country which are famous for tourism. the locals might be conservative themselves, but they've adopted to their regions being tourist sites and get on with quiet happily.

 I'd ask questions about the bomb attack at the mosque, and the nuances of ""travel safety"" in Pakistan. I don't know where to start but would appreciate more context.  
 Travel safety is of course paramount wherever we go, and keeping ourselves safe is a big part of travelling responsibly.  
 But travel is also a privilege, where whenever a ""destination"" gets too unsafe for us, all we need to do is remove ourselves from there and move on with our lives. Whereas for those who are local to your ""destination,"" this is a reality they live with. 
 Whatever the backstory is, based on your pictures you seemed to have encountered some generous people who have blessed you with their genuine presence, hospitality and kindness. There's gotta be a story of great resilience and a rich culture of having each other's backs through what must be a far from easy life.

 Pakistan is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, deeply segmented society. Most important divide is (like the world over) between have and have-nots, AND of course level of education (somewhat different than literacy). 
 If a tourist is visiting Pakistan on his own, without a reference and/or host,  will have a totally different experience than a visitor with some reference/ host. 
 Even for local boys, interaction with girls outside family, co-ed inst, mix work environment is somewhat less likely. It used to be better in 60s/70s. Religou-cultural influence of Iran and Saui Arab deeply impacted our culture and traditions.

 There's a lot of hype about Playdium in DHA. You should check it out. 
 Last I heard, Joyland had gotten pretty boring, so it's up to you if you want to visit. 
 There are a couple of laser tag places. I personally haven't tried them, but my fiance has. You can look up on maps for that. 
 There's also 2-3 padel sports spots. It's a good activity for evenings. 
 If you're looking to explore mosques and historic place, then there's always spots like Badshahi mosque, Hinar Minar etc (though that's a small travel). 
 You can also reach out to farmhouses to see if they offer horse riding. 
 There's a bounce spot in Lake City. You can also visit Lake City Mall to watch a movie. If you're actually hoping to see a movie, I'd recommend Cue. 
 If you're in cue, you can try out boba tea from tattle tea house. 
 MM Alam,  Emporium and Packages Mall.

 In May I'm traveling to Europe/the UK for four months, in two phases. Phase 1 is solo 1st May to 22nd June, Phase 2 is with someone 23rd June to 31st August. 
 Here's what I do know: 
 . What I'm doing the first 5 days.
. What date I'm flying to Iceland for a week (cheap flights).
. What date I'm flying to Scotland for 6 days (cheap flight).
. What dates I'm flying to Svalbard and back (cheap flights), plus where I'm staying (not many options so they book out). 
. What date I'm meeting my travel friend in Rome. 
. The dates of two organised tours (I'm a tour guide and get discounts from my company when traveling).

 . With car hire (booked), where I'm going in Iceland.
. With car hire (booked), where I'm going in Scotland. 
With a 3-month unlimited global Eurail Pass, exactly where and when I'll be traveling throughout Europe.
With car hire with my friend, when and where in the Balkans/Eastern Europe we'll be going, or for how long. Not yet booked anything.  
 I suspect I'll be in each country only a few days, but that could easily change.

 I realize it's not the most obvious route, but that's because I had bought a cheap flight to Penang many months ago. It was substantially more affordable than flying into Chiang Mai, Bangkok, or KL, so I figured I'd start there and move around. 
 Your comparison to Canada is inacurate as the distance between PEI and Vancouver is more than double that of Chiang Mai to Singapore, not to mention domestic flights would be far more expensive.

Reddit,"Six week itinerary Malaysia, Thailand, and maybe Singapore. Looking for input or suggestions!",Glittering_Foot_2461,"as far as the 6 weeks being short, its not about the length of time, I completely understand that everyone has time constraints but it was more about trying to cram too many places which makes the whole epxerience rushed and more focused on getting from place to place rather than enjoying each destination. 
 
 Penang, Maylasia (Dec 28-Jan 1): While I love a good party, and was ... 
 
 Penang is an interesting place.  Food is great.  Street art is interesting.  If you are going to spend a few days, take the ferry across to Butterworth for a quick daytrip.  The area is not a big party destination so it will be on the quiet side.  NYE is not really a thing and i doubt that there will any huge fireworks party or anything like that. 
 
 Khao Sok National Park, Thailand (Jan 1-3/4): I'm still trying to figure out the best way... 
 
 Flying into Phuket is the best way to get to Khao Sok.  There is a public bus that runs from the airport directly to the park.  After the park, explore Phuket and take the ferry to Krabi you can either just stop at the islands or you can book separate ferries and island hop.    
 
 Koh Tao, Thailand (Jan 4-8): I was really torn between Koh Lanta and Koh Tao to get my Open Water ... 
 
 Koh Lanta is VERY chill.  A really big island so scooter would be the best option.  The island is NOT the white sand clear blue water type place.  Really natural beauty.   
 
 Chiang Mai/Chiang Rai, Thailand (Jan 9-12): I've heard such great things about Chiang Mai .. 
 
 Chiang Mai has a really different vibe.  Obviously inland and a lot of hills and fields.  Chiang Rai is not really a day trip, too far.   
 
 Bangkok, Thailand (Jan 13-17): I know a few people living here that likely have ... 
 
 Bangkok is Bangkok.  Ayutthaya CAN be done as a day trip but it will be LONG day.   Plenty of nice places to stay overnight.   
 
 Sabah, Borneo, Malaysia (Jan 18-24): I haven't done much planning for this portion of the trip yet, ... 
 
 If i am being honest, i would probably skip Borneo.  Its a really long trip to get there and even on the island getting from point A to point B is long as everything is really far apart.  You would either fly into Kota Kinabalu or Kuching.  Again each city is interesting and there is a lot to explore but getting around is difficult.    
 
 Singapore (Jan 25-27): I'd like to check out Singapore for a few days, but could potentially scratch both it and Malacca to spend more time in Borneo. Thoughts? 
 
 Singapore is a hub so either way if you are making your way back to Penang, you will probably have to connect either through Sinagpore or Kuala Lumpur.  Obsviously VERY expensive compared to everywhere else, but worth a 2day 1 night stay. 
 
 Malacca, Malaysia (Jan 28-29/30): It sounds like an awesome place to spend a few days, 
 
 If you visit Singapore, there is a bus that you can take from Singapore directly to Malacca and then onto Kuala Lumpur.  Worth a visit.  Great food, interesting history. 
 
 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Jan 30-Feb 1): Mostly I want to spend a few days eating food then go to the Thaipusam festival at Batu Caves (which is why this date is sort of fixed in KL). 
 
 batu Caves are nice, but  its insanely chaotic during the festival.  
 
 Cameron Highlands (Feb 2-4): Seems like a nice change of pace, if only for a few days. 
 
 The traditional route is KL to tanah rata (Cameron highlands) and then Ipoh and then Penang.  Definitely a change of pace and particularly the weather is VERY different.  Nice and cool. 
 
 Langkawi (Feb 4-6/7): At this point I feel like I didn't schedule enough relax/beach time and don't want to venture back into option. 
 
 Tourist island.  Nice beaches, but touristy.  You can cross over to Koh Lipe for a quick trip, but depending timing, it would be much easier to go to penang from ipoh or Cameron highlands.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ps5bly/six_week_itinerary_malaysia_thailand_and_maybe/

That's probably more focused on just the tourist activities, however, and I do appreciate just slowing down and exploring places without much of a plan some days.

 So, most flights back to Penang will connect through Singapore or Kuala Lumpur anyway, (and you want to see the Thaipusam festival) so skip Borneo.    
 Even if you skip Borneo, as mentioned, six weeks is not as long as you think so you won't be able to ""slow down"" as much as you think.

 Stay on the Andaman side to dive, it's better, then personally I'd leave it open ended from there. You might want to dive more, if so consider a liveaboard if you're really into it. Fly from wherever you are to Chang Mai, then Bangkok, and on to Mayaysia, Cambodia (Angor Wat is worth a detour), or my favorite, Vietnam. For the most part, you can go anywhere in SE Asia the next day for relatively cheaply, so I'd just research some options and see what you feel and the weather. Borneo might suck in the rain, for example.

Reddit,"Six week itinerary Malaysia, Thailand, and maybe Singapore. Looking for input or suggestions!",BRCityzen,"A few thoughts from someone who has done most of these recently: 
 Penang: 5 days is way too much. I found 2 days to be enough... except for the food. I would've liked to try more restaurants. 
 Koh Phangan: (I know you're not going there but maybe reconsider). I'm quite a bit older, went there solo, and had a blast... everywhere BUT the FMP. FMP is overrated. Every expat I met warned me, but I needed to see for myself. I don't regret going at all, though, because there are many other things to do, and the 4 days I spent on the island were not enough. The parties were great, and there are plenty of raves and parties outside the FMP -all of them better. And in the daytime there are plenty of great hikes, beaches, and good food to try. 
 Other islands, I can't comment on too much. A word about scooters and motorbikes... I think you made a wise choice. I've seen so many tourists have accidents on motorbikes in SEA, including Thailand. The statistics for accidents in Phuket are staggering. Happened to me in Myanmar, actually, and it sucks. Another very legitimate option, especially on smaller islands -splurge a bit and rent a car! That's what I did. It's safer and more comfortable. 
 Bangkok: Very vibrant city. 4 days is about right for a first time visit. Personally I'd prefer weekends especially if you're into nightlife. Food is the best. Rooftop bars are amazing. Ayutthaya is VERY doable as a daytrip. I got an early start, rented a bike, and was perfectly happy to take the afternoon train back to Bangkok to sample more of the nightlife. 
 Sabah: I think a week is definitely worth it. I did a VERY meticulously planned 1 week trip to Borneo that included an orangutan sanctuary, Bako NP, Kuching, and Mt Kinabalu, with a flight between Sarawak and Sabah. Some would say that's packing way too much, but it worked. If you stick to one state in Malaysian Borneo, I'd say definitely enough time to see the best it has to offer. 
 Singapore: authoritarian police state with fake trees. For me, one day was enough and I have no desire to go back for more. 
 KL: I think you're shortchanging KL just a bit. KL is a bit odd... for attractions, that's probably enough. Batu caves requires no more than a half day. Transport is remarkably easy. By day 3 in KL, though, I had found that while I'd thoroughly exhausted the things I really wanted to see, it was a real struggle to pick and choose what to cut out from the food list. The food is really that good, and varied. And since you mentioned the food as one of your highlights, I'd maybe give it another day. 
 CH: very nice place to spend a couple days, especially if you like to hike. 
 This trip seems epic! Didn't mention Malacca or Langkawi because I haven't been there. But... I chose to not go there for a reason. I did a lot of research and decided that my time was better spent elsewhere. For me, the question was, do I really need to see one more town or one more island? Or can I get the same things with less hassle elsewhere (I.e., try more food in KL and Penang, instead of Malacca; get more beach time in Borneo or Thailand instead of Langkawi?). You may want to consider the same calculation.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ps5bly/six_week_itinerary_malaysia_thailand_and_maybe/
Reddit,"Six week itinerary Malaysia, Thailand, and maybe Singapore. Looking for input or suggestions!",Antoine-Antoinette,"I can’t comment on Thailand as I haven’t been there. 
 I also don’t know how bad the monsoon gets in Borneo.  
 But if you are just going to Sabah then six days should be plenty. Maybe drop a day as people are saying diving activities and Mount Kinabalu are not good in monsoon. 
 Eat seafood at the Todak Waterfront Hawker Centre - nice vibe, seafood and prices. Go down the river. 
 I think you should keep Singapore in your itinerary and maybe give it an extra day. 
 I would also keep Malacca in your itinerary. It’s a cute town. Visit the Baba & Nyonya Heritage Museum. Also check out the very nice temples. 
 In Penang check out the perankan museum and the blue house. 
 You will now have visited three perankan museums but they are all good and you will understand the Chinese presence in the region better. 
 In Singapore go to Chinatown, little India, the buddhas Tooth temple, lagoon hawker centre on east coast. The national museum gives a very good overview of the history of Singapore. Walk down Geylang road in the evening and eat and drink beer. And eat durian if in season. You will be with locals not tourists.  
 I would probably drop Cameron highlands to reduce rush. Although maybe you appreciate the cooler air for a couple of days. 
 Get grab app for rideshare in Malaysia and Singapore. I have always found Malaysian taxi drivers quick to try and rip you off. They often want to charge a flat fare rather than use meter and their first price is not good. 
 In Singapore CDG Zig all is also good for taxis - sometimes cheaper than Grab. 
 Singapore MRT is a wonderful train system but strangely I use taxis and grab more. But I travel with my wife and maybe friends so it works out financially better for us than a solo traveller. 
 Buses are generally a great way to get around Malaysia. Comfortable and cheap. I usually just bought tickets on the day and at bus stations and didn’t have any problems but maybe you should research that. There is probably online booking these days.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ps5bly/six_week_itinerary_malaysia_thailand_and_maybe/

Reddit,"Solo Trip Advice: Czech, Poland, Hungary & Italy (15–31 Oct)",VermicelliScared7196,"That is a pretty packed schedule, I won’t lie. With 16 days and 7 cities, you might end up spending more time on buses than enjoying the vibe of each place. I’ve been to all your Czech stops and living in Budapest, so hopefully I can help simplify it.   
 Instead of overnighting in Karlovy Vary and Brno, I’d suggest using Prague as a base. Both make perfect day trips by bus—you’ll get the experience without all the hassle of moving your luggage and checking in/out of hotels. Karlovy Vary is beautiful but very quiet in the evenings, and Brno, while fun, is compact enough to see in a day.   
 Three nights in Budapest is doable, but just barely—it’s a city that really rewards a slower pace. The ruin bars, thermal baths, and street life are some of the best in Europe for meeting people and just soaking in the atmosphere. If you can steal an extra night from somewhere else (maybe Milan?), you won’t regret it.   
 Speaking of Milan—it’s great for a football match and the Duomo but it’s not as laid back or historically immersive as other Italian cities. If you’re set on the game go for it! But if not, consider swapping those two days for more time in Krakow or Budapest. Krakow’s main square, pub scene, and day trip to Auschwitz are deeply impactful.

I was an average middle class Pakistani who’s every day was a struggle. Here in America I don’t make a whole lot of money and I am probably in lower middle class or poor income bracket but each morning I wake up, I don’t have to worry about not having hot water to shower because there’s no gas and geyser won’t work, in summers I don’t have to think twice about crazy high electricity bills if I turn on the AC because it’s so hot. I also don’t have to worry about back pain from commuting on broken roads or keep looking over my shoulder that a mobile snatcher might be coming my way.  
 Sure, I am a bit stressed sometimes about the visa and all but honestly this country is a place where you get rewarded proportionate to your level of efforts. No one is low balling you, the harder work you put in, the bigger the reward.  
 And as for, doing everything by yourself and not having servants or househelp for everything: well my dishwasher does the dishes, the washing and drying machines do the laundry, max I have to do is sweeping/mopping the floors and cleaning the surfaces and my bathroom. If you make good money then you can also hire cleaners for fortnightly cleaning too.

Reddit,Why America?,Alone_Topic6601,"Different people, different circumstances... 
 I moved here in 2019 fresh out of university. Now I'm in a 6 figure position. 
 It took hard work and didn't involve odd jobs. Point being if you're willing to put in the hard work - you'll get the results. Unfortunately, a lot of Pakistanis that move here come with a mindset of 'reaching here' is the finish line. And now that they're here, they're guaranteed success.  
 When the reality hits and no maids come to do the dishes, cook food and they don't directly land the positions they were imagining. They simply settle for an uber gig or a convenience store job and never push forward.. That's were the 'yahan mushkil life hai, Pakistan main mazay thay' narratives come from.  
 Ultimately, you'll get success if you are willing to put in the hard work. This is something that cannot be said about living in Pakistan. Middle class families have a far tougher time changing their situation in Pakistan. Many of my university friends in karachi are doing insane hours and still living hand to mouth.

Reddit,Why America?,3381024,"Well said, I'll add a few more points:  
 
  US is the largest economy in the world. This mean more jobs, and in a lot of cases, better jobs.  
 Pay scale is hugely different between US and Europe. My EU counterparts make half the money for the same job.  
 Believe it or not, but US is still more affordable than EU - for the most part. Translates to a much better standard of living  
 English is the default language. Countries you mentioned speak German. If you speak other European languages, great, but you will have a problem in non-English countries if you dont speak the language  
 Not a very visible class-system. US has a large,  merit- based  middle class, which means that you are not confined to the social class you are born in.  
 People are a LOT less racist towards immigrants. Obviously a lot of that sentiment is changing, but for the most part, US is still a lot better than most of EU and elsewhere. Its a lot more easier to assimilate in US than other places.  
 
 Another aspect is more personal. Are you a skilled professional? Do you have a specialization. Are you in IT, Medicine, research, Law, etc. If you are not a skilled profession, you will have problems everywhere you go, including the US.  
 In Season 1 of Amazon's Jack Ryan series, a French police officer says to Jack Ryan: ""In America you have this concept of Italian American, Irish American etc. In France, you are either French or you are not. ""  I guess that kinda sums up the difference between US and EU's social structure.

2. Access to buying house, cars, furniture etc if you have a good credit score on as low as zero percent interest (minus this offer for home, as you have to pay interest on it).

This comes with the expectation that you are also okay with other people living their lives freely and as they wish, which to me is a very good thing.  
 If you’re middle/upper middle class and come to the US, you can expect a bit of a culture shock because there are no maids, cooks, cleaners and you will do everything yourself. If you make enough money you can hire someone to come in a couple times a week but it’s not cheap.  
 You can work hard here and be more successful than in many other countries. There is a ton of opportunity even through things are not handed to you on a plate.  
 There is a certain amount of peace in working hard and being left alone to do your own thing which is what I like about life here. I have no doubt that for a working class person, America offers a quality of life that is simply unattainable in Pakistan - you just don’t have access to the same economic mobility in Pakistan.  
 I do miss friends and family, but in Karachi I used to feel overwhelmed with constant social interactions and obligations which are far more manageable here.  
 I also have the opportunity to pursue hobbies here which are hard to pursue in Pakistan from a cost and time perspective.  
 In Karachi, all my spare time used to be spent chasing down a lineman for shitty internet service, a water tanker for water, servant drama, traffic jams because “route lag gayee”, repeated attempts to get the same things fixed over and over (cars, appliances, whatever).  
 Here I have that time to read, pray, build (carpentry, drones as a hobby), ride mountain bikes, hike, camp, etc. I am also able to pay for my parents needs (healthcare etc) in Pakistan while earning in the US because the currency conversion works out very favorably.  
 When you get old, Pakistan again pulls ahead - people around so you won’t be lonely, affordable health care, can afford medical attendants, drivers, cook whatever 24/7 etc.  
 So ultimately you have to analyze where you are in life and see what tradeoffs you’re happiest with. I’m very glad I had the opportunity to have access to both Pakistan and the United States. I love both.

Reddit,8-Day Lebanon Itinerary (with a rental car) Thoughts & Inputs Welcome!,ZobiLaMoche,"I did a similar trip in 2014, limited to Beirut and environs (including Baabda) and the Beqaa' Valley. Eleven years is an eternity when it comes to the situation in Lebanon. That said, 2014 was a relatively peaceful time in Lebanon, and it was not advisable to self-drive out to the Beqaa'. I hired a driver for the day, recommended by the front desk at the Mayflower Hotel in Hamra, where I stayed for the month. Once past Zahle, there was a very obvious Hizbullah presence everywhere, in big white SUVs, often congregating with uniformed Lebanese military. The driver did a lot of talking at checkpoints, but we had no problems other than the frequent stops. 
 The owners at Chateau Ksara were wonderful hosts, and sent me on my way with a complimentary bottle of araq, which my companions and I drank at the deserted Baalbek ruins. Baalbek ranks among my very top ruins experiences anywhere in the world. Afterwards in the town, some Hizbullah bros invited our drunk asses to dinner, which was delicious. They sent me on my way with a souvenir Hizbullah flag and coffee mug, with an maliciously grinning portrait of Hassan Nasrallah on the side. We were back in Beirut shortly after dusk. 
 In Beirut proper, I tended to stick to Hamra, Ashrafieh, and Gemmayzeh. The nightlife in Beirut is unbelievably good.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1nlgxrx/8day_lebanon_itinerary_with_a_rental_car_thoughts/

I've only been to the Bardo, Sousse Archaeological Museum and catacombs, El Djem and sites in Carthage, so this is a great guide for other sites in the country (my degree was in Classics so I have a deeper interest too) 
 I'm half Tunisian myself (other half is British, I only speak a little French and a few words of Arabic), and I've travelled there my whole life up to 2017. I've heard rubbish has become a major issue recently (I think related to issues with government) which I know wasn't the case in the 2000s/2010s, but it's a huge shame to hear about heritage conservation issues.  
 I feel like Tunisia had the potential to become more touristically upmarket like Morocco but I know there is a real lack of interest and respect for heritage and tradition (most younger people seem to aspire to more modern/""Western"" things and there's also a lack of economic prospects for them there, so I guess it makes sense

 We hired a local chef to take us on a tour of some of his favorite places, ending up in the Mercato di Sant’Ambrogio. He introduced us to many of the vendors, told us what to buy at each, and then assembled everything we bought and had another vendor cook and put it all together in a meal that we ate right there. An amazing day where I actually felt like a real local. 
 Similarly, in Seville, we hired a local art historian to walk us through the cathedral. That turned into a day long outing walking through his neighborhood, visiting his church, and stopping in at all the little shops and restaurants that he loved.  
 As much as I loved Barcelona, I felt like I was steered from tourist attraction to tourist attraction. Great stuff, to be sure, but I never felt like I ate at a restaurant or visited a bar a local would go in.  
 Bonus: we took an e-bike tour of the Appian Way in Rome. The guide was great, an Aussie expat. When my wife really fucked up her ankle in Naples, she texted him asking what he could tell us about the medical system.

I'd say do Bangkok first then Hanoi then Danang, a little bit of a detour geographically since you'll be flying up North then down South again but I'd leave the most relaxing part of the itinerary toward the end! 
 Bangkok and Hanoi will pack a punch with their large populations and loudness whereas central Vietnam has its own charm and is slower-paced. Hoi An is a cultural and historical gem! A really romantic place at night so don't miss it! Would recommend staying in Danang and using it as a base to visit Hoi An (was about a 30min drive when I went) and Hue (was almost 3h from my resort). Drove past Lang Co Bay on the way back from Hue too and it was stunning and so serene.  
 The resorts along the stretch between Danang and Hoi An may get crowded during certain periods though, but the expansive beach is beautiful and breathtaking, especially from higher grounds. Would recommend staying at one of the resorts if resorts are your thing!

And you can easily fly to Phuket or Chiang Mai for cheap, or Koh Samui for a bit more. I just got done there and I think Thailand is the best introduction to SEA.  
 Affordability though goes to Cambodia. Beautiful country with amazing history and the temple complexes are straight from the movies. There’s tons of high quality food in Siem Reap and it’s cheap too. They even use USD so it’s convenient.  
 Vietnam was nice but you need to be a bit used to SEA I feel. Roads especially aren’t friendly like they are in the west. No easy public transport imo.  
 Malaysia has great food but is a bit more expensive. And it’s pretty modern and might not feel as exotic. I’m in Sabah now and it hits all your requirements except it rains daily.  
 IMO take the leap and do Cambodia. Siem Reap for 4-5 days won’t break the bank and you’ll learn a lot of the history of the region as the Khmer empire used to control much of it, centered in Siem Reap. You can learn about the religions and understand their long rivalry with Thailand. It’s also very easy to relax and chill, cheap massages and drinks everywhere and you can even get laundry done for under $8. If that’s too exotic then stick to Bangkok.

Reddit,First-time solo traveler: France vs Malaysia vs Hong Kong vs Vietnam vs Thailand,dgoldenpc,"Personal preference for a solo trip for me would be Hong Kong.  
 Ridiculously safe, even late at night. Geographically small but it is one of the most vibrant cities and full of character! Because of its size, it's also ridiculously to get around the city on public transport. You'll almost never need public taxis. The city is also very walkable. Been to Hong Kong several times and I've never been bored of the city. There's just so much to see and do and the city has so much to offer. Skyscrapers, waterfront promenades, hiking in nature, ferries to outlying islands, there's just aplenty. Food is really wonderful too. But of course, they all come with a price tag. Hong Kong is not cheap and expenses for a 1.5 weeks trip will add up very quickly. 
 Malaysia is a good alternative but your excitement may fizzle out if you remain in the same city for 1.5 weeks. Consider fitting a few cities into the trip. They have a comfortable intracity train service and domestic flights are affordable too so it's easy to move across cities. KL has a pretty robust metro system but once you head out to other cities you'll be relying on buses more but grab (the local version of uber) is very affordable! Some cities like Penang and KL actually have a free bus service within town catered to tourists (though locals ride it too). Malaysian cuisine is great too! It's diverse and different places have their own specialties! 
 Hong Kong, in my opinion, is a good stepping stone for female solo travellers but it can be expensive. If you're gonna be relying on public transport more and affordability is a key factor, I'd say Malaysia is a good choice!

It's best to put some downtime parts of the trip at the end, as it's rough to want to do and see things having already done it a ton before recently. 
 I'd say 2 or 3, but treat them as a reset and rest period. 3 might work better since it's cold and you'll less likely feel the travel ""guilt"" of not going out to see things as much. But if you're missing the social aspect then you'd want to do 2 and be somewhere safe with your friend.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pxzm1b/travel_fatigue_wrong_country_or_just_bad_luck/

That’s the key right there. Traveling just to travel is pointless and will leave you feeling like that every time, that’s why Workaways are so great. You’re being productive, learning and improving, meeting and forming bonds with lots of new people- usually locals. Every time I felt like that (dozens of times lol) getting busy always helped.

Reddit,"Travel fatigue, wrong country or just bad luck?",closequartersbrewing,"I've done several trips of more than 12 months. I also had just a superb experience in Columbia. So I think I can weigh in here. 
 The absolute best thing about solo travel is the freedom. Go where you want, when you want. If things aren't working for you, you can change it up. If Colombia isn't working for you, you can leave easily! You could go to San Pedro de Atacama in Chile, then take a multi day 4 by 4 tour into the Bolivian desert which is incredible and quite cheap. You could go to Argentina, to Equidor, go to Peru, the world is your oyster. 
 On the other hand, I found Perilla and the area to be an incredibly social town full of backpackers. I have my best social experience over 3 months in South America in that town. I made so many friends on the hike to the incredible palm trees to playing tejo, it got to the point where any bar I would go into I would know some people and be able to sit down with them. And unlike you I'm not a complete extrovert. It was just that good. Experiences will vary and maybe you won't have the same one, but man I had fun in that town. 
 If I were you I'd give it a try, and if it's not working, leave. Embrace the freedom :)",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pxzm1b/travel_fatigue_wrong_country_or_just_bad_luck/

That can certainly put a damper on your mood and perspective as you feel vulnerable… and it’s a country that’s going through a bit of a rough patch lately. As a Latina that is familiar with S Amer, Cent Amer & Caribbean, I’d say you’ve seen enough and should move on. Sometimes I feel like we miss some sort of message when we try to force things. Colombia has plenty of beautiful and amazing sights (that your now seen a good bit of) but it has enough seediness and unsafe areas for a solo female traveler. Connecting with a friend might be a great reset… have you considered going far south and visiting Chilean (or Arg) Patagonia?  Or even the Atacama. (No offense to my Chilean friends but I wouldn’t waste time with Santiago, not much there.)  There is magic in the natural landscape of Chile and Argentina. It’s very restorative and some areas are not very touristed, especially in comparison to an area like the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, etc.    
 I’m sad to say I am not familiar with Asia (yet). But if your heart is there, follow it and go where you feel safe and the energy is positive. I feel like travel is meant to feel like an adventure. And a big part of that is feeling free to explore without the fear and discomfort of being in potential (even if just perceived) danger.

 We started out gently with a Viking River cruise earlier this year.  It had been planned for 2.5 years. My spouse has been wanting to try them out because his family does cruises.  We're also figuring out that eventually travelling like we do will have to change  over the next 14 years as we age late 50s-60s into 70s.  
 It was nice.  No complaints about the boat.  Just the nature of group travel was an adjustment,  especially having  minders  lol.  Happy we accomplished our own travel schedule before & after it.  
 Using discounts & credits, we've booked another river cruise in 3 years.  We figure its time of year  & places that we normally do not travel + we'll be staying the entire time on the boat.  (The one this year was combined w land stays).  We'll travel on our own to the starting city & spend a few days prior & plan the same on  the other side.

 Ugh.  I'd hate that too.  Id be so snappish by the end from the constant push that I'd need a vacation,  lol.   That was the plus of this Viking tour.  I picked out & paid extra for special excursions in advance because we knew some of tge region, plus the one was to a place Id bern dreaming about as a kid.  But there were daily included excursions too that were great or you could venture out on your own. 
 You could choose beforehand to purchase a higher beverage package, but selections were quite good without.  The only item not included was tips for the boat personnel.  That was billed and reasonable for the very excellent care they provided.  Everything was immaculate.   
 The river boat was really nice.  Quiet places. No gambling. No requirements to dress up for dinner.  My only gripe was that the primary individual in charge of the lounge music turned everything into muzak aimed at all the boomers.  We're Gen X and were horrified to hear  90s & 00s music twisted like this. Everything by this guy sounded similar.  One man synth.   shudder 
 They brought on local musicians every night and they were really good.  Food was excellent.  Thankfully we did a lot of walking pre & post or we would have been waddling home with the amount of food provided.

Reddit,Germany/Czechia Trip - Advice for first time in Europe,EmbarrassedBadger922,"I like your Berlin part of the trip. It is clearly well researched (maybe a bit stiff to plan every day out like that but you can still be spontaneous) but everything after that is a bit too fast. You put the relaxing part at the start and the exhausting part at the end.  
 Two full days in Prague is too little in my opinion and I would switch one night from Munich to Prague. Leipzig only seems to be a stop for the Football Match, which is a shame since the city is a great day trip from Berlin. Check out the monument to the battle of nations if you can.  
 Your Barcelona plan is bonkers but you seem aware of that. Your time in Munich is very limited. A football match and another possible day trip means basically zero time there. The train ride from Prague is also long, so the day you go from one city to another will be a pure travel day. Munich is an expensive city to stay in, only for you to use it to be anywhere but Munich. I would suggest you skip the day trip and spend some time in the city instead. There are many traditional bavarian restaurants in Munich to choose from. The Hofbräuhaus is the restaurant belonging to the brewery with the same name. Since Munich has 6 large breweries, you can just choose another brewery adjacent restaurant for an authentic experience.  
 On day 6 you plan on visiting the Görlitzer Park in Berlin. Unless you want to buy drugs (I am not judging), you should stay away from that area of the city. The Treptower Park with the soviet monument or the Tempelhofer Flugfeld are much better choices for a walk through some greenery.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pyhnse/germanyczechia_trip_advice_for_first_time_in/
Reddit,"Planning my first foreign trip to Europe, need your guidance and option",AlpineNavigator,"Your itinerary looks good but a few things from experience: 
 Day 5 is too packed. Zaanse Schans + Edam + Marken sounds doable on paper but ferry schedules kill you and Zaanse gets absolutely mobbed after 11am. Pick two max. Honestly Marken + Volendam feels more authentic than Zaanse anyway. 
 Český Krumlov to Salzburg is rough. There's no direct connection and you'll burn half day on buses and trains via Linz. Either skip Krumlov (painful I know) or add a day. Arriving in Salzburg exhausted ruins the whole point. 
 April weather in Austria can be brutal. Your Filzmoos and Altaussee plans are great but have indoor backups ready. The alps are unpredictable that time of year. 
 You're castle-heavy. After your third fortress things start blurring together. Maybe swap one for Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna or National Museum in Prague - both are world-class and break up the pattern. 
 Don't skip: that vineyard walk down from Prague Castle at sunset. Hardly anyone does it and it's stunning. 
 Overall it's doable but tight. I'd drop either Krumlov or one Dutch village day just to give yourself breathing room when you're actually there and tired.",9,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pykfsr/planning_my_first_foreign_trip_to_europe_need/

Reddit,"Planning my first foreign trip to Europe, need your guidance and option",Christy_Mathewson,"Looks like a great trip. I've been to Amsterdam and Salzburg and they're both beautiful cities. I like that you have each day planned out but just be flexible knowing it might not work out that way. There might be a rainy day that changes things or some place might be closed. You might also just need a recovery/lazy day and that's okay. You've obviously done your research of what to do in each city, just make sure you use it as options and not what you HAVE to do.  
 I usually spend 2-3 days in each city when I travel. You don't know how much you'll love a place until you get there. If you feel like you've seen what you want there are always bus and train trips to close by smaller towns or national parks. My very first international trip included Edinburgh and Dublin. I had 3 nights in Edinburgh and I didn't want to leave, I fell in love with that city. I had 4 nights planned in Dublin but realized after the first day that I wanted to explore more outside the city. I found a bus that went to Belfast one day, one that went to the west coast another day. So, be flexible and don't feel like you need to stick with your original idea only.  
 You're going to have so much fun. I live in the US and have done many trips like this in Europe over the last 20 years. Traveling has helped me grow as a person and appreciate the culture and history the world has to offer. Make friends in hostels, even if they're just friends for a night or two. Play games, do bar crawls, make dinner together. Plus, fellow travelers have inside knowledge. They might have just come from the next city you're going to and can tell you if the restaurant you're looking at is a hidden gem or overpriced tourist trap.  
 Don't over pack. I recommend a backpack instead of roller bag. It's so much easier going up and down stairs and over cobble stone streets. Be okay with pictures of you being in 3-4 shirts. I promise you're the only one who will be paying attention. You can find a Laundromat in the city if you have to do laundry so you only need to pack 4-5 days worth of clothes (extra underwear is my exception). 
 Free walking tours are a great way to see a new city. You tip the guide so it's obviously not ""free"" but you pay what you can afford. If you're an athlete running through the city at sunrise is a great way to see a lot without crowds. Enjoying a cup of coffee at an outdoor cafe and watching the city wake up is a great experience. Instead of the tourist place in the middle of the main square choose the place two blocks away.  
 Other unsolicited advice. Download Google maps offline and translation languages for where you're going. Learn the basic phrases for where you're going (good morning, thank you, please, may I have a beer please, etc). Have cash as a backup, especially if you might be going to smaller towns. eSIM are cheap and helpful.  
 Be ready for this trip to open up your world and mind. Hopefully it starts a lifelong addiction for travel like it has for me.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pykfsr/planning_my_first_foreign_trip_to_europe_need/

 Yes Rovaniemi is a small airport and running at capacity.

(I was delayed two days returning from Croatia last year. Again queues and poor communication etc etc but that was all down to the airline). 
 You also flew to a city with 65,000 residents and where over 500,000 tourists come during the winter months. Most of those in December on the run up to Christmas. There is infrastructure in place but it was never designed or planned to handle that many people. 
 The airport was expanded in 1992, in mid to late 90's it was up to around 55,000 foreign visitors a year. Now it's ten times that due to the 'instagram' and tourist generations. It has just had more expansion work completed in October but again they couldn't plan for thousands of extra unexpected people from delays. 
 Never heard of high km old vehicles at the rentals unless you booked an unknown brand last minute. Prices are high as limited vehicles available and most people book 6-12 months in advance. 
 There isn't tourist 'exploitation' as such, they just price things to make money off you. If people will pay that much then they can charge that much, simple. You can do it all more reasonably priced if you look around and research far in advance.  
 I am shocked how much loads of the Brits pay to come over on package deals with TUI etc, often ten times more than booking things separately and planning well. Now that is definitely exploitation.",33,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pyi9sq/winter_adventure_in_lapland_experience/

 Unfortunately, I can imagine being an Indian makes this experience even worse.

There are often laws in place that restrict racism and unfairness that are actually enforced. 
 Not so in the Eastern former Soviet states.
In Russia, landowners will freely advertise "" No X ethnicity in my house"" blatantly for housing etc and it is publically tolerated.

Reddit,9 days trip to Portugal in May - Looking for itinerary advices,spookyneo,"Both itineraries look solid to me. I'd probably do a few day trips from lisbon and spend a few days in Porto myself.  
 
 So you would lean more towards the first itinerary ? What day-trips would you do from Lisbon and/or finetune my itinerary to your taste ? I think I would very much like to add Evora or Obidos to either itineraries for the historic part of them. 
 
 Isn't the train from Lisbon to Porto only like 2-3 hours? Not sure I'd consider that a waste of time personally.  
 
 It is about 2H50. If you include the time spent at the train station, I suspect it's about 7-8H in the trip wasted. However, on itinerary #2, we would spend more time traveling by car...so I guess both itineraries have time wasted in transport anyway.

Reddit,9 days trip to Portugal in May - Looking for itinerary advices,CurlySlothklaas,"Nine days in Portugal! So great! 
I spent a week there a few years ago, focusing on Porto but flying in and out of Lisbon. Because I think you have the time, and because of your interests, I highly recommend spending a night in Óbidos and traveling by train Lisbon -  Óbidos - Porto. Óbidos has a lovely public library and is one of the Cities of Literature with lots going on. Plus the castle and walled city itself. In Porto, skip Livraria Lello and go to Livraria Chamine da Mota on Rua das Floras instead. I went there over several days because they had so much stuff! Lots of other bookstores too. 
Caveat: I spent only two nights in Lisbon and not in the city center so can't truly compare it with Porto. I just loved Porto so much.

 That is an interesting recommendation. I've always read that Obidos is worth about half a day. I really enjoy looking at videos of Obidos for the fortifications and history around it. I will dig more. 
 Your comment is also giving me an idea of visiting Obidos and Coimbra on our way up to Porto. We could go to Obidos, then Coimbra and finally Porto. Either spend the night at Obidos or Coimbra. Am I packing too much ? 
 We could take the Alfa Pendular when getting back from Porto to Lisbon.

Reddit,9 days trip to Portugal in May - Looking for itinerary advices,Aloevchu,"Hi mate, Canadian here. Driving in Lisbon is not like driving in Canada. It has a lot of one-ways, and the drivers tend to stick to each other a lot. If you have experience driving aggressively like you see in some 3 rd  world countries, I’d say go for it. Otherwise, I’d say UBER everything. 
 Sintra crowd is real. I knew the crowd was real, so I made sure to go on a weekday and skip a lot of landmarks; and I was glad, because when I saw the bus driving past some of them, I laughed. Be ready to consider taking a private car to return to the station vs public bus. Because it might be crowded, and/or people pushing and shoving and cutting in lines. Also, there will be a lot of people selling private tours; it is up to you if you want it, if it fits your budget. 
 I skipped Porto. I know a lot of people love it, but I watched videos of it and decided it wouldn’t be a dealbreaker for me; so I can’t offer input on it. If you want to consider more places, I would recommend picking a place in the Algarve region. Different cities will offer different vibes. I would say the highlight is mainly if you take a boat tour to explore caves and dolphin encounter. 
 If you’re not big on beach vibe, I would say you can consider opting out of Cascais.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pzkyz3/9_days_trip_to_portugal_in_may_looking_for/

 Be careful with food. Don't eat the raw bean sprouts in Pad Thai. Many locals also don't. Raw bean sprouts are high-risk food. Sour and spicy food can upset your stomach. If you find other backpackers from the hostels to eat together. Try eating the Thai way i.e. ordering several main dishes to share instead of ordering a one-dish meal which will limit the choices by a lot. Mid-range restaurants with a more extensive menu can give a much better experience when you do this. You can buy probiotics drinks from 7/11. This should help. 7/11 also sells a lot of non-prescriptive medications. 
 I hope you have a great time. Good luck.",10,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1pzwwc4/two_firsts_in_two_days_solo_travel_and_leaving/

Reddit,Arizona trip advice!,Picklesadog,"I lived in Arizona for 6 years, half in the Phoenix metropolitan area and half in Flagstaff. 
 Sedona is going to be ~2 hours each way from Scottsdale. You can do a day trip, but just be aware it will include a lot of driving.  
 Is there a particular reason you're staying in Scottsdale? The entire Phoenix metropolitan area is... well, it's really not that great for much of anything. If you've never been to the desert, I guess it could be interesting, but the entire area is kind of a chain restaurant filled grid of 4 lane roads, a real ""Cheesecake Factory"" kind of place. It's extra not walkable, so you'll either be driving yourselves or will be spending a lot of time in an Uber if you want to enjoy the nightlife. I'd only recommend Scottsdale to someone who wanted a golf/shopping/spa trip. 
 If I were planning a trip to Arizona, I'd make Flagstaff my home base and go from there. Flagstaff is a fun little city, very walkable downtown with tons of boutiques, restaurants, and bars. It would be cold in February and maybe snowy, but it still has lots to see and do and the nightlife will be just fine. Sedona is a ~1 hour drive, as is the Grand Canyon, and lots of other outdoorsy things are around as well. Despite being significantly smaller than the Phoenix area, there is just much more to do, much more culture, and far more diverse scenery. 
 If you're dead set on Scottsdale, you can drive out to the Superstition Mountains and beyond for some nice hiking and true desert scenery. The Cave Creek area also has some nice scenery and hikes. You could do a trip down to Casa Grande to see some ancient ruins, or up to Casa Verde. 
 Honestly, I spent a lot of time in Phoenix both living there and visiting my mother. I like Arizona a lot, but the Phoenix area, including Scottsdale, is just kind of... not great. It's for people who like living in their bubble.",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q03p6t/arizona_trip_advice/
Reddit,Arizona trip advice!,scruff829,"Since it’s a quick trip, staying in Scottsdale and trying to squeeze in Sedona would be tough. It’s about a two-hour drive each way. If it were me, I’d table Sedona for this trip and save it for next time, when you can pair it with Flagstaff. There’s plenty to do in that part of the state, and it deserves its own visit. If you do head north - Flagstaff has a crazy zip-line, tree course. Mind blowing.  
 Now, back to Scottsdale — an amazing place that I’ve visited dozens of times. Old Town / downtown Scottsdale has some fun bars and great energy. Grapevine is a cool spot, and AZ88 is solid for food and drinks. The Tortilla Factory is also a good stop, and there’s an excellent tequila bar/hut on the property that’s worth checking out if you’re into tequila. 
 For activities, hiking Camelback Mountain is a classic. It usually takes about 90 minutes to two hours to reach the top, and the views are fantastic. 
 Tempe is just south of Scottsdale and has a lively college-town vibe near “A” Mountain. You’ll find fun bars, great food, and if you’ve never been to In-N-Out Burger, it’s a must-try — total cult following. 
 Another option is Tucson. North Tucson is especially nice, with beautiful trails and scenery. If you don’t already have the AllTrails app, download it — everything is GPS-based, and Arizona hiking will blow your mind. Downtown Tucson can be a bit gritty, but North Tucson has great restaurants and some very nice hotels. This is a two hour drive south, so, it too should be enjoyed on a different trip.

 What you have in Uganda works well if you are flying between the areas, otherwise, it will be a lot of travel, especially on Day 10.

 My reason for considering Tarangire, Lake Manyara, and the Ngorongoro Crater was to experience a variety of wildlife and landscapes - for example, tree-climbing lions, the abundance of flamingos in Manyara, and the iconic baobab trees that aren’t found elsewhere. I understand the Crater can get quite crowded, but I thought its unique scenery would make it worthwhile. 
 We’re keen to minimize travel time and truly enjoy being present rather than rushing through a checklist, especially if the wildlife isn’t significantly different.

with five cubs there and would love to hear if they’re still around!), then Seronera area for big numbers of predators. (If seeing all of the big five is important, though, Ngorongoro is your best bet for rhinos.) If it fits your budget, flying from Seronera is very attractive, but we were told you need at least four people to fly (or you’ll be charged for four people).  
 If you have time, I highly recommend the habituation trek in Uganda; this could be instead of or in addition to the regular trek. Be aware that the trekking may be challenging; we did four in a row between Rwanda and Uganda and the last trek, which was the hardest, really kicked our butts! 
 Rwanda was more expensive but easier trekking and easier gorilla viewing, with nicer lodging. It’s quite the police state, as compared to very laidback Uganda.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pzxw3e/tanzania_and_uganda_itinerary_feb_2026/

 Mothers have this fear that their sons will be stolen away from them by the wife, which is stupid but its how majority of them think.  
 I personally would never get into this typa position in the first place but i havent been married so idk shit.  
 What do i know from observing family members is that sometimes, distance is the best you can do. Even islamically your parents are not your responsibility, your wife is. She comes first.  
 Fuck everyone else, if your mom is creating a hellhole for her to live in then either change your mom or change where you live. Its kinda impossible to change parents and old people in general so for me personally its not worth the effort. 
 Also broski, what the fuck? You need to learn how to take care of yourself and do basic shit, if your mother dies, whose going to be doing all the work? Your wife? Wont she get pissed by it? Wouldnt that cause an entirely new problem it self?, so think of this as a blessing in disguise for you to learn how to take care of yourself and do basic shit that everyone should know how to do. Trust yourself. Trust your judgement.  
 Dont choose between wife and mother but if you have to, id say choose wife. Id personally choose mother because my mother is an old cunt and no one else can really deal with her shit for another decade or two, i dont mind.

Reddit,Struggling after moving out of parents home after marriage - need perspective,Sad_dead_bird,"From your parents perspective the issues are:
1. You are now shared, between them and your wife. They think you are a part of them physically and should remain a kid. 
 
 That you have changed habits/compromised- which to them its a betrayal. 
 You treating her lovingly is a trigger for your mom , Im gonna go on a limb here and say your dad never did that for your mom. She sees it and feels jealous. Read on emotional incest and Pakistani womens generational trauma. 
 Their standards for you and her are massively different- desi parents think bahu should know how to cook, clean, take care of house, be submissive, talk to their relatives, pray a lot, look fully glammed at parties/weddings.
They don’t have those standards for you, just her because she is a girl and not their own child. 
 Her dogs, her being white or revert is not the issue. If she was a Pakistani from gaon - they would treat her same or way worse. Its the belief system that bahu’s spirit should be crushed /controlled - just cause inlaws have power. 
 Desi parents are scared of change. Most of them carry anxiety, some even depression or bpd. They can’t cope with change and nothing you can do will make it better. 
 
 You need to stay strong. You did the right thing. This is common in a lot of desi households and in the end the couple moves out. Then they are guilt tripped and cursed and reminded how much sacrifice was done for them. 
 You might not get appreciation for it because its a bare minimum thing. Protecting your marriage from unwanted people is how you have a healthy marriage. If you don’t protect your marriage- it will break apart and your parents/others won’t give a shit.

Reddit,Struggling after moving out of parents home after marriage - need perspective,DefiantClue3405,"Hi There! Moving out of the toxic situation was the right decision and you should stay put; don’t let the guilt trap make you feel guilty to the point that you move back with your parents. Home sickness is a natural thing for all people when they leave home for the first time. Respect your parents but not at the expense of your wife which is your family now.
I would bet that your mom would have similar issues even for a wife she brings for you from her own family. I am old enough to have seen all this around me for so many families. Stay put; find a job, go to local masjid, make new family friends and settle down for yourself. No looking back my dear. From what you have described, your wife is very nice person who wishes you see happy even if you leave her alone; she is definitely a keeper and don’t lose her. She needs to be treated with respect and love of a good Muslim husband. This is especially true since she is a new to Islam and you leaving her alone might dishearten her to the point that she might leave Islam. Don’t let that happen on your watch. Be strong and seek strength from each other when you are in weak moments. 
Buy Desi groceries and start cooking together and enjoy the moments together. Keep contact with your partners and visit them once in a while but don’t even think of moving back.",0,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1q0bn5d/struggling_after_moving_out_of_parents_home_after/

 For the rest, it sounds mostly pretty minor to me. Sure, not ideal, but that is how travel works, things are rarely exactly as expected. Just be a bit flexible. I mean is it really that big a deal to make a small detour to avoid an unwalkable area? And why would a visit to Jiufen/Shifen be 'for nothing' only because a good number of restaurants were closed?

 My friends and I in a big group of 7 were followed in Paris a few years back. Just one guy, one of the African scammers hanging around the Eiffel Tower. The girls picked up on it right away, as a guy I was oblivious, hadn’t traveled many places back then and had never been followed before. But we’d stop, start, and move randomly and he kept with us just 20 or 30 feet back. The girls decided to stop on the bridge “for a picture” to force the guy to keep moving. When we stopped and started to pose he went right over to another scammer posted up and they acted all buddy-buddy taking a picture and we hurriedly slipped back into the crowd the second he turned his back.

Reddit,"Yes, It's over.",AlbertMalarkey,"Sri Lankan here, no complaints about the revolt on my behalf.  
 Here are the key systemic improvements that have emerged since 2022: 
 
 Strengthening Institutional Independence 
 
 One of the most significant shifts was the move away from centralized executive power toward independent oversight. 
 The 21st Amendment:  
 This constitutional amendment restored many provisions of the 19th Amendment, reducing the unilateral powers of the Executive President and re-empowering the Constitutional Council. This ensures that high-level appointments (like the Chief Justice and Election Commission) are vetted by a multi-party body.   
 Central Bank Independence:  
 A new Central Bank Act (2023) was passed to prevent political interference in monetary policy. This aims to stop ""money printing"" for political gain—a practice that contributed heavily to the 2022 hyperinflation.   
 
 Comprehensive Anti-Corruption Frameworks 
 
 The Aragalaya focused heavily on ""catching the thieves."" In response, the legislative framework for fighting corruption has been modernized: 
 Anti-Corruption Act No. 9 of 2023:  
 This replaced outdated laws, giving the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) more teeth, including the power to investigate money laundering and private-sector bribery.   
 Proceeds of Crime Act (2025):  
 New legislation was introduced to facilitate the recovery of stolen assets and the forfeiture of wealth obtained through illegal means. 
Regulation of Election Expenditure: For the first time, laws were enacted to cap and regulate the amount of money candidates can spend on election campaigns, aiming to reduce the influence of ""black money"" in politics. 
 
 Economic and Fiscal Modernization 
 
 To avoid a repeat of the 2022 collapse, the state has shifted toward a more transparent and disciplined economic model: 
 Tax and Revenue Reform:  
 The government reversed the disastrous 2019 tax cuts, widening the tax base and introducing a more progressive income tax system to ensure fiscal sustainability. 
 Cost-Reflective Pricing:  
 Subsidies on fuel and electricity—which previously drained the treasury—were replaced with market-based pricing models combined with targeted social safety nets like the ""Aswesuma"" program to protect the poorest. 
 Energy Sector Liberalization:  
 The state-owned monopoly on fuel was broken by allowing international players (like Sinopec and United Petroleum) to enter the market, improving supply chain resilience. 
 
 Political Culture & Digitalization 
 
 The protests fostered a more ""engaged"" citizenry, leading to changes in how the government interacts with the public: 
 ""System Change"" via the Ballot:  
 The 2024 Presidential and Parliamentary elections saw a historic shift away from traditional political dynasties toward the National People’s Power (NPP), which campaigned on the Aragalaya’s core values of transparency and meritocracy.  
 Digital Governance:  
 There is a renewed push for ""Digital Sri Lanka"" to reduce human intervention in state services (customs, tax collection, land registry), which is a key systemic method to curb bribery. 
 
 Social & Ethnic Solidarity 
 
 While difficult to measure legally, the Aragalaya achieved a rare moment of cross-ethnic unity. For several months, the divides between Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities were bridged by shared economic hardship and a common goal. This has created a lasting discourse on the need for a ""new social contract"" that is more inclusive and less reliant on ethno-religious nationalism.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1q1pvis/yes_its_over/

As for renting a car, you can definitely do that, but Caucasian roads aren’t known for being the best, especially in winter. Marshrutkas are cheap and go pretty much everywhere, so I’d rather use them instead.

London has over a thousand years of just random topsy-turvy and ramshackle development.  It has a billion curious alleyways that lead to other weird spaces.  All interesting and deeply historical.  
 Paris had a wrecking ball put through it, and while now stunning, much of the architecture has a same-same vibe.  The old, old Paris is gone.  In London, for instance, you can still walk up to the water pump that gave the city a cholera outbreak in 1854 in Soho.  Or drink in the pub where David Bowie first performed live (the Victoria Paddington).  Paris has treasures like this, many of the older ones gone.

When I was at my airport departure gate, I saw that the rental car company had charged me for a full tank of gas. They had inaccurately thought I did not top off before returning. I had some back and forth with the rental car manager, who passively aggressively asked me if I wanted him to pull out the car to double check their automated telemetry fuel gauge. I then contacted the national company and filed a complaint. I had my gas receipts, showed them the distance between the gas station and the rental car agency, and how the amount of fuel the rental car branch said I was deficient in did not match up. For example, I fueled up 5 gallons and the gas station was only 5 miles away from the airport. I would not have used up 5 gallons to drive 5 miles.

 Never use third party sites (such as Expedia) for flights. Flights are too prone to changes. 
 Third party sites can be okay for hotel bookings on the other hand only if it's significantly cheaper and easier than booking directly on the hotel's website, and I'm not going for some very important and popular event which will likely fill hotels to their capacity. 
 Same with Airbnbs, although I stay the hell away from Airbnbs outside of North American due to safety and ethical concerns. Unfortunately hotels in the more desirable areas of US and Canadian cities can be absurdly expensive, and the hotel and hostel options in these places are quite bleak. 
 Check the weather, since it can very much impact the experience. In NYC, Times Square can look magnificent in a snowstorm, but walking across the Brooklyn Bridge would be very unpleasant.

 Personally, I make sure to avoid booking any properties that are on AirBnB for the full year, since these are contributing to the housing shortage that’s happening in much of Europe. But when I can rent someone’s apartment while they’re on vacation, that’s ideal. And when I’m solo-travelling and I don’t want to stay in a hostel, I’ll usually look for something where I’m just renting a bedroom and the host is verified and has good reviews—usually it’s still cheaper than staying in a hotel or an individual room in a hostel.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q30cav/my_travel_ten_commandments/

 Intelligent gentlemen, a polyglot and extremely courteous. 
 We even made a brief stop to stretch, he needed a smoke and we watched the sunset before continuing on to Mosul. Despite us being tired from the long drive, he guided me on a roundabout way to the hotel so he can show me the points of interest in the city and a short history lesson.

Reddit,Solo Ghana–Togo–Benin overland trip (2 weeks) – itinerary & transport advice?,1938R71,"Yes, absolutely. 
 I was a western diplomat in Accra. I had done the pan West African Highway a few times.  
 No matter where you go, you’ll be able to experience rich culture. 
 Although it has been a very long time since I’ve done this, there are two pieces of advice I’d like to dispense.    
 
 A long time ago, I spent most of my 20’s travelling  extensively throughout 63 countries, mostly developing and often some very poor places .  That includes very insecure or precarious places (like driving by myself from Islamabad to Beijing, passing only 1.5km from where Osama Bin Laden was hiding at the time), North Korea, along the Afghan Border, Syria, and many others.   
 And the only place I was ever violently assaulted, held up and mugged, was on the outskirts of Lome, Togo.  I was in a taxi, driving back into the city from the East, on the Pan-West African highway.  I took a photo of an old-style looking gas station (hand pump on the has pump), and a Nigerian sitting there, saw me take a photo just as our taxi got caught and stopped in a traffic jam.  He jumped up, ran to my taxi, flung open my door, held a knife, and ordered me to give him my camera, as he tugged at my backpack at the same time. 
 Fortunately for me, a large group of Togolese rushed him and came to my aid.  I ended up losing my portable disk drive to him with hundreds of photos.  But that was all.  I couldn’t thank everyone enough. A couple yelled out they hate when foreigners come to their country to cause trouble.  
 But the point is that security is a bit precarious with a lack of ever-present law enforcement. 
 Therefore, travel light.  As a senior manager in one of our embassies said to all staff when they lost their wallet in an open-air market, do you really need to travel with 3 credit cards, a gym card, your birth certificate, your home drivers license, several membership (ie Costco) or discount cards, home provincial health care card, etc etc?  If not, then don’t.   Travel light.  Travel smart.  If you’re doing day trips and then returning to the same hotel at the end of the day, leave your original passport in the safe, and take only a photocopy with you.  Use a money belt pouch that fits inside your pants (not outside).  Don’t wear an expensive watch or jewelry.  Don’t hand bags off the back of your restaurant chair.  Don’t put things in your back pockets or lose pockets.   
 Again, I lived in west Africa a long time ago.  But back then people  hated  having their photos taken, even in crowds if the photo wasn’t centered of them, or specifically of them.  People would get very very upset.  Respect that, period.  I found out the hard way.   But I had seen people get upset over it many other times.  I don’t know the true reasons (local friends told me it was because people thought westerners were doing it to show how poor people were, a couple others told me that some religious voodoo people thought the images would capture the soul, etc).  Regardless or the reasons, be aware it can be an issue, and be conscientious of it.   With cell phones cameras everywhere now, maybe it’s no longer as much an issue now as it was before. But just be aware of it. 
 
 Have a blast.  I certainly did.  My time in west Africa taught me a lot about life, myself, and the wonderful people who live there.  What an amazing time you’re about to have!",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1q3oc3p/solo_ghanatogobenin_overland_trip_2_weeks/

 A few questions:
- How did you move around from place to place? Was it private driver, shared taxis…?

You’ll see and do so much! 
 I did busses, taxis, planes, private personal vehicle.  Living there you take every type of transport.  And I didn’t have to rush within a short period.  But in your case, buses, and hired cars should be fine.   If you do a northern jaunt for 3 days, maybe save time and fly to a northern destination, explore for a couple days, then fly back south.   That gives you more time for exploring the south.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1q3oc3p/solo_ghanatogobenin_overland_trip_2_weeks/

There are different styles to travelling / backpacking, but the best memories I collected were always made by having only a rough schedule and being open to flow with the situation.

 Secondly, my favourite part of Paris was wandering the streets, stopping having wine or a snack, people watching and then moving on to the next place.  
 A few tips that might help you:
- Find restaurants or coffee shops you want to try. Stop for 1-2 things and move on, use that to guide your wandering. 
- Only plan 1-2 things a day, after that leave it free you'll have to wander to find things",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q2yt1z/how_to_get_better_at_wandering_when_traveling/

 For example, let’s say i needed to answer some emails or make my christmas list.  Rather than get it done in a hotel room, i’ll find the local coffee shop or library.  I may also take a long a little quest (oh…i need to pick up face wash).   At that point - i’m walking to the library but i have to keep my eye out for somewhere with face wash.  I know this sounds stupid, but it slows me down enough that i see the bookstores, the antique shops, or the cafe where a lot of locals appear to gather.  1/2 the time i don’t end up where i though i would.  In this example, i’d likely end up at the cafe full of locals.  I’ll sit and do my christmas list and respond to email and engage with the locals.  As a conversation starter, i ask them where i can find face wash.  hahahaha.  
 anyways..i intentionally leave space for this in between the big tourist attraction days.  they turn out to be my most memorable days. i feel like im less a tourist and more like with the local  environment :)",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q2yt1z/how_to_get_better_at_wandering_when_traveling/
Reddit,How to get better at wandering when traveling,roambeans,"I think it could happen naturally, in time. I've traveled a lot and have lost interest in a lot of typical tourist attractions. I don't bother with churches and mosques anymore. I rarely pay for tours now - it has to be something pretty special. I will go to parks and ruins and museums if free. I am only willing to pay if an attraction sounds proportionally interesting to the cost of entry. I am still often disappointed. I think most people would lose interest in typical tourist attractions given enough exposure to them. 
 What I really love to do is walk. I just start walking in a direction and see where it takes me. Some of the most fabulous days I've experienced just happened because of where I ended up. But I also hate taxis and will walk to destinations that are less than a few kilometers.

 Destination 2 
 Dinner spot  
 
 I walk between destinations if possible and try to select places that are a reasonable walking distance from each other.  
 As you’re walking between each destination you’ll just happen upon interesting things to see. Maybe there’s a cool store that catches your eye and you duck in to wander around.

 Tulum isn't the boho chic magical vibe that it was 15, 20 years ago but there are a ton of great spots that can be found with research. 
 I was there from Dec 20-Jan 3 and before that in November.  I've been to Tulum about 15 times since 2007. 
 There are tons of authentic yoga/pilates studios + other mindful wellness spots. Beach clubs in the beach zone are 2-5x less what you would find in hotel zone and you get to bike on the much more calmer road. 
 In Centro, there are so many nice dining options + cheap and cheerful spots.  I haven't had a bad meal in Tulum since 2019. 
 The street dogs are sad to see yes, but most of the world doesn't have the luxury of animal control departments like we do in Toronto (I saw one of your replies). I take solace in seeing their big bellies and chill demeanor hanging outside one of the many outdoor restaurants. 
 And the poverty you saw was likely along Av Kulkulkan and I agree with you ... but it's Mexico and even the glamorous Mexico City has rough areas.

We stayed in the east Algarve, almost at the Spanish border, in Praia Verde, as we have family there. I would however as a base choose somewhere closer to Tavira or even Faro - makes distances to west Algarve better manageable.  
 We really like Tavira. It’s small but pretty, and there’s a really fun camera obscura in an old water tower, where you can live view the city - our ‘guide’ there was amazing, very funny and interesting. Great for kids I think!  
 We also did a boat trip to the Rio Formosa area, with stop at Culatra island. If you’re not seasick it’s good fun! The boat goes so fast and bumps on the waves. Nice breeze too in the summer heat.  
 Faro is also nice and worth a visit.

 It's one of the few places I have been where I feel like I miss it and dream of going back.  
 We stayed in an apartment in Funchal and rented a car and the infrastructure is so good and easy, and each ride we had jaw dropping views throughout.  It was fun to plan and explore and we stuck with easy hikes that were stunning.  
 The beaches are not sandy beaches and the water is rough. We ended up going to a pool right on the ocean 2 days in a row after some little hikes.  Not something we typically do but we loved it. You will get alot of coastal views and rocky views but not sandy beaches so make sure you look into that.

There were four of us and we spent some time staying with family/friends, so I’m not sure how our budget would compare, but I’d have thought £10k would be fine. If you use Quantas for the international flights you can get a reduced price on internal flights.  
 I would not try and do both countries, you can barely do one of them justice in 3 weeks, so save the other for another time.  
 The leg from Melbourne to Sydney looks great. I looked into trying to do it over 3/4 days and it would have been doable, but not much fun. Taking at least 5 days gives you plenty of time to explore Philip Island (penguins and seals), Raymond Island (koalas), Barunguba ( more penguins and snorkling with seals). You can see kangaroos everywhere, including on the beach at Durras and Depot Beach.  
 I wouldn’t go as far north as Cairns at that time of year, it will be very hot and wet, and you might get a cyclone thrown in as well. The southern reef is well worth a visit though. If the budget stretches I’d recommend somewhere like Heron Island, where it would be turtle nesting season.

Also it's likely a lot more driving than you are used to (6-8 hour driving days, or more, are possible. Estimate first with google maps) 
 You can rent a car for the entire time, but you would have to return it before some of the bigger cities unless you want to pay a fortune in parking. 
 Trains here are not great, but for the east coast, it would work. Boston, NYC, Philadelphia, Baltimore and DC are all on one route - you can stop along the way in Rhode Island and Connecticut. If you travel off peak times in coach, it's very reasonable (Acela high speed train would be more $$). I personally would do the cities I wanted by train, and then maybe rent a car for a week or two to get out into some of the other areas you mentioned.  South along the coastal cities by train, then back north with a rented car through Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, NJ and NY. Tennesee is do-able if you don't mind driving extra - but keep in mind that Nashville is pretty far west from the other cities in Tennesee - but worth the trip IMO. If you decide to continue south on the train you can reach Charleston, SC and Savannah, GA which are beautiful places and maybe my favorite east coast places outside of New York. 
 Hotels can be crazy expensive in the northeast cities but you can find really good deals. Limit your city days if you have to. Food/alcohol in the cities is also pretty crazy expensive in some places but again - do some research in advance or stick to more casual food and street food for some of your meals.

I'm big on tent camping, so in your position I'd be planning to do this with a 70L trekking pack and carrying a single tent and sleeping bag along with me.  I wouldn't camp all the time, just sometimes, to save money.  I think finding places to stay is going to be your biggest challenge financially here.  In some of those areas, even a modest hotel will get you close to $200 USD/night.  So I'd spend most of your research time figuring out the best way to handle lodging. 
 I think that whole general route will expose you to a lot of cool experiences.  The upper east coast is much different than the southern east coast.  Florida is its own beast and a day or two or week in Miami might be worthwhile. 
 Check out amtrak routes and prices.  As you know, US (even just the east coast) is way stretched out and we usually recommend renting a car when visiting USA.  That said, the east coast amtrak train infrastructure is pretty good and you will probably find that you can hop between cities and avoid renting a car for at least a portion of your trip.  There will probably be times you need a car though.  Especially that upper south area.  Appalachia would be a good target and you want a car (luckily great camping areas and the correct season). 
 Amtrak will get you to Miami too, if you wanted to take my advice on checking that out. 
 No matter what, the area you've covered will give you a wide variety of experiences.  I think that's probably what you're going for anyway.

I like to factor in an extra write off day for arrival and departure just in case you need them to adjust or settle. Make sure you research your accommodations and if they’ll be staffed when you arrive as some places aren’t 24h. I’ve noticed a lot more of these cheaper “pod” sleeper hostels lately too in the larger cities. How do you handle the heat? Might be worth some extra money for AC relief at night. Do you think you’ll take public transit? A lot of the time you can buy multi day transit passes.

If you really want to immerse yourself in a few places rather than just get a taste of a lot of places, it is probably best to pick a region so you aren't spending too much time in transit and get a feel for the overall area.

Sarajevo mixes Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and modern European history in one city. 
 Not everyone wants a cheap holiday, sure. But popularity usually comes from a mix of food, beaches, prices and overall vibe, not just elite archaeological sites.

Reddit,Looking for a small midwest town in the mountains for March,poopsy__daisy,"These maps always drive me a little crazy and I get weirdly passionate about it. My personal take: 
 The ""Middle West"" was defined pre-Louisiana purchase and then culturally strongly influenced by the Rust Belt (which includes parts of PA and NY but those really are historically Northeast). The Midwest does not include MN, IA, or MO. IA is solidly a Great Plains state. North and central WI and eastern MN, as well as the Upper Peninsula, are pretty unique from everything else, given their deep Scandinavian roots and their landscape and ecology. But Milwaukee is so close to Chicago, and very much a part of the Rust Belt... Give it to IL. Milwaukeeans would hate this lol. 
 KY is just plain weird. The north is heavily influenced by the Ohio River and industrialization, the East is Appalachian, and the south is The South. If we are going on the Civil War, though, it was a border state (along with MO and WV... Speaking of which, what the hell do we do with WV? I don't have an answer.) 
 MO is an extra tricky mix, bordering the Midwest (IL), the south (AR), and the Great Plains (IA). The east is culturally Midwest (especially St Louis having a long history and Rust Belt feeling), the south and central Ozarks are AR feeling, and the northwest being plains feeling. 
 Honestly, UT is barely in the Rockies, which just skirt the state in the Salt Lake area. We should add a desert region for UT, NV, AZ, and NM.  
 For MT, if you've ever driven through it, you know the majority of it is plains. The ""100-something miles until next services"" signs on the highway are hilarious and unsettling. Tbf, I haven't made that drive since 2010, so maybe that mileage has dropped? Even so... It's truly the middle of nowhere and solidly in the Great Plains.

Reddit,Backpacking Europe in Summer. Pls help!,Ambitious_Vast1611,"I can tell you're excited but anxious about the trip. Let me go through them one by one.  
 For hostels, booking 2-3 days ahead in June - August is cutting it very close, especially in popular cities like Lisbon, Barcelona, Rome, etc. The good hostels (safe, social, well-reviewed) fill up weeks in advance during peak season. You'll find  something  last-minute, but it might be expensive, far from the center, or sketchy. 
 I’d suggest: Booking a loose skeleton itinerary, using sites like hostelworld, booking.com with free cancellation policies. This gives you safety nets while maintaining flexibility. You can cancel or modify as you go if plans change. 
 For travel, buses will be your cheapest option (best for short distances, long ones might be uncomfortable). Budget flights for long jumps, book 2-3 weeks ahead for €15-40 flights. Train travel is scenic but expensive without a Eurail pass.  
 Trains and buses through popular routes should be booked a few days ahead for cheaper pricing.  
 As for how to planning, plan this much now: 
 
 First 2 weeks of accommodations (with flexible cancellation) 
 Rough route with ""anchor cities"" and approximate dates 
 Budget breakdown  
 Travel insurance (non-negotiable) 
 Copies of required docs 
 
 Figure out as you go: 
 
 Exact day-to-day activities 
 How long to stay in each place (you might love Portugal and want an extra week) 
 New cities people recommend along the way 
 Side trips and day excursions 
 
 One last thing, join Facebook groups like ""Girls Love Travel"" and ""Solo Female Travelers"". They're really useful for real-time advice, meeting up with other travelers, and safety tips for specific cities.",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1q43u9k/backpacking_europe_in_summer_pls_help/

Reddit,Backpacking Europe in Summer. Pls help!,Sicvos,"I would definitely have the first bit of the trip planned out. It can take a little while to get comfortable and having a bit of security makes that easier. Hostels can be expensive last minute, and the goods ones tend to get booked up in summer, so while playing by ear is definitely doable  it’s an added challenge. Maybe book some in the big cities and use it as a framework. Always with a cancel option. 
 I second what some others have said about Eurail passes. If you’re traveling a lot over a period of time it will save you a lot. I’ve never had an issue booking train tickets last minute. Only exception would be for limited ones, like from mainland Europe to U.K.  
 If you don’t want to plan every detail, you don’t need to. There’s some things to book ahead for, like really popular museums (Vatican, Louvre, etc), but most things are fine day of or a few days advance. I’d reiterate that at the beginning, especially if you haven’t solo travelled much before, having a more structured itinerary will help you a lot. In my experience, with culture shock and jet lag it takes me a few days to really get adjusted, so having a somewhat structured start, ideally not in a really chaotic city, is a good idea.  
 Always make sure to enjoy it as well! Sometimes traveling can feel like a rush of finding things and trying to see everything, but you’re there to enjoy yourself. Take it easy and do what you want.

Reddit,Backpacking Europe in Summer. Pls help!,klm9192,"You got great advice. I think such a long trip needs some planning, at least this was the way i did in the past. But I have to admit last time I backpacked through Europe was more than 10 years ago and i am a overplanner!  But still i can assume planning more important nowadays than before because of over-tourism in most locations 
 How I would plan: 
 
 Admin/Entry/Visa situation: I would inform myself definitely beforehand, depending on where you are from check what you need. If you are coming from a country with free schengen travel scheme, as someone else also suggested, you might need to book a return ticket, and still fill entry forms etc 
 Accommodation: I would book actually all my accommodation before hand. You are planning to travel in high season with lots of touristy locations, good hostels with good prices fills up quite early. Not booking will lead to high prices and not so good accommodations. You can also choose 48h cancelation options which would give you more flexibility (As a solo female traveler this was my biggest safety planning - having a good and secure hostel) 
 Travel: I am not sure if interrail is as cheap as 10+ years ago. But as others suggested it might be a better option than individually checking each country’s rail services and will give you more flexibility. But for interrail, you still need to do some research, since it is not a simple ticket which allows you to take all trains in Europe. I remember in some countries (NL, ES, FR etc) either i had to pay extra or there was some limitations on which trains i was allowed to get in. Also probably there would be distances in your journey where there would be no good options of railways and need to switch to busses etc. In some countries bus schedules might be more flexible (i remember in Greece I could even book on the day in the bus station- but again this was some 10 years ago). Thus i would check what are your options going from A-B, whether you can book it spontaneously, like busses can be more appropriate for spontaneous booking, also for short distances in some countries, you do not need to book regional trains in advance (since the price is not changing and there is no seat reservations) 
 
 4) Budget: You did not mention what your budget would be, but such a trip can lead a quite a bit of cost, especially if you do not have a good plan. Having a plan for points 2) and 3) will create the majority part of your budget. Then you can do a little bit research online on how much daily budget you might need for each location (for food, events and tickets, night out, souvenirs and some buffer). Switzerland will be the most expensive location followed by France and Italy, Balkans might be significantly cheaper. At my time I would travel with bunch of cash (plus it’s anxiety), but nowadays you can pay with cards in most of the places. Check with your bank whether your card has low transaction/exchange rate fees and plus if you can use ATMs in Europe without fees. 
 5) Travel insurance is a must, in most locations hospital visits wont cost thousand euros (of course depending on what you have) but still can accumulate a lot (last summer had to go to a private hospital in Lisbon and it would have cost without a insurance around 250 Euro) 
 What remains is how would you structure your days in each location, but this is also something you can do either later or during your accommodation search phase (depending on what you want to do in each city, you can determine how may days you want to stay in a place etc)",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1q43u9k/backpacking_europe_in_summer_pls_help/

Train tickets get really really expensive there, so the cost of the pass is easily covered. Look for sales around Easter time. Keep in mind you still need to purchase a seat reservations on lots of these trains. Busses for Eastern European countries and Balkans can often be the cheapest way to go.

Reddit,Planning a solo trip to the US - NYC or LA?,Awkward_Apartment680,NYC. The good public transportation system compared to LA will make all the activities you want to do easier. NYC is also far less spread out; in LA you’d have to drive everywhere and deal with the traffic to get to places.,6,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q5gucp/planning_a_solo_trip_to_the_us_nyc_or_la/
Reddit,Planning a solo trip to the US - NYC or LA?,_CPR__,"Depends on when you're going. I assume since you said after graduation it would be spring or summer. I'd choose NYC, but try to make it longer than a week if you can to have time to get outside the city. My ideal first trip to the northeast where it's mostly via public transit would be: 
 
 Fly into NYC, spend four nights, visit the Met, MoMA, and the Tenement Museum, Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, catch a broadway show, walk around the Village, eat great food including pizza from a slice shop and a bagel every morning. Check out the NYC-focused subs for cheaper hotel recommendations.  
 Take Amtrak to Boston and/or Philadelphia for 2-3 nights each. DC is also easy on Amtrak but a bit of a longer train trip. The added appeal of DC is that most of the museums and monuments are completely free (unlike NYC).  
 Once back in NYC, take MetroNorth up to Beacon, or Amtrak to Hudson or Rhinecliff/Rhinebeck, to see another side of New York State. If you go to Beacon, you can visit the Día art museum. If you go to Hudson, visit Olana State Historic Site, the most beautiful house in the US (IMHO). Or if you are comfortable renting a car, drive up from NYC into the Hudson Valley and visit other small towns and do some hiking in the Shawangunks or Catskills.",5,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q5gucp/planning_a_solo_trip_to_the_us_nyc_or_la/

I think if you’re looking for nature, there are better first trips. NYC if you’re concerned about crowds, look to stay at hotels further from midtown. neighborhoods like LIC or Williamsburg have short (less than 10 min) train rides to Manhattan and while still the city, arent the zoo of Times Square.  For a 7 day trip, I wouldn’t leave the city outside of maybe taking a day trip to the beach(Rockaways, Long Beach can be accessed by train) or hudson valley for some nature (Cold Spring or Beacon are easily accessible by train).

Reddit,Advice Itinerary Malaysia,BRCityzen,"I was there in March of 2025, so I can speak to some of this. 
 To do justice to KL, I would spend 3 days, if only to eat through some of the delicious food. 
 Penang is about right. Interesting museums, great food. Blue House that everyone wants a picture of is nice, but the Green House is the real star attraction. 
 I skipped Melaka because I decided my time was better spent elsewhere. If you really want to see Melaka, it can even be done on a daytrip from KL. Not sure what you want to see in Gopeng. I'd maybe add the day to KL. 
 Cameron Highlands is much easier with a car, but doable without. I picked up hitchhikers who would've had some long walks, and it gave me more flexibility. You'll spend more time and money on taxis without a car. The hiking is nice, but be prepared for adventure; many of the trails are crazy steep and muddy. And there are surprisingly few people hiking. Malaysians don't hike. Download a good offline map app, like maps.me. Google maps is worthless for hiking. They are slowly closing down the numbered trails in favor of more development, which is a crying shame. But there are enough left. 
 Don't underestimate the steepness. I remember doing one hike -I think Trail 10. It was supposed to be 2 KM or so, and I decided I'll just be lazy and take a taxi to the top and crank it out by morning. Well, it's good that I did it that way. First, good luck finding a taxi that will take you there. I had to beg and pay triple the price, and I can see why because the car barely made it -oh but what views! Then, several muddy and scraped up hours later, I emerged at the bottom, minus one sole on my hiking boots and thankful that I didn't twist my ankle. My hiking poles on this trek were more a hinderance than a help, because it was not a hike, but a several hour jungle climb! 
 On a different note, I unexpectedly enjoyed Flora Park. On second thought about the car... just do yourself a favor and get the car. 
 Borneo... February is dry season in Borneo. Bako NP is perfect at that time. Try and find someone to go in with you for the boat ride, otherwise it's pricey. Taxi too, in order to get there. I was lucky that I met these two girls from Lithuania staying at the same hotel. Split the cost of the taxi back as well as the ride. 
 The park itself can be done in one day. Start EARLY. If you do have time, you might see a little bit more staying overnight and hiring a guide, but I was fine on one day. Again, do not underestimate the hiking in Malaysia. I originally wanted to do a loop around the island, but that would have been impossible in one day. I originally settled on various trails that amounted to 9km. Again, I thought easy-peasy... But No, once you get off the main trails, it gets rough. And with the humidity, you will sweat buckets. When I got back to the cafe, there was not a single spot of dry clothes on me. And I am not an out-of-shape, inexperienced hiker. 
 Surprised you didn't mention Taman Negara in your itinerary. But maybe it's good. It was the most underwhelming part for me. 
 I also spent time in the Kuching area, and I really loved the Orangutan sanctuary. Kuching is also a pleasant town. Strolling the waterfront and hearing the speakers blaring David Guetta as the fountains were going off -that was something I didn't expect. 
 Lastly... you know that a couple weeks after your trip, it's Ramadan, right? I traveled on Ramadan.  I was a little concerned, because I thought stuff might be closed. In fact, Ramadan is literally the best time to go. Far fewer crowds and everything is still open, including restaurants. Just fyi, just in case you're able to change things around a bit.

Reddit,Advice Itinerary Malaysia,BRCityzen,"Mt. Kinabalu... ah, Kinabalu. What is there to say? I've written entire trip reports about it. Some say don't go. Crazy expensive. And btw, it may already be too late to reserve. But it was truly an experience of a lifetime, particularly with the via ferrata (Lowe's Peak Circuit). Dry season is good, but seasons are all crazy now in Malaysia. Expect rain at any time. I certainly had my share in March, though thankfully not on the via ferrata itself. The group on the previous day had to do it in the fog and rain. That would be damn near impossible. 
 Splurge on a porter, though sometimes one can't be found. My guide offered to do it, and I paid him full price but took half my gear because he also had his own to carry. I thought I could crank out 6KM to the huts no problem -that shite took me 4.5 hours, and when I got to the hut, they actually told me I was the first to arrive! I'm not a super athlete, and twice the age of most of the people doing this, but the secret is in the hiking poles. Here, you would be crazy not to have them. Even so, by the time I got to the top, I was drenched, not sure how much of it was sweat and how much was rain, nor did I even care.  
 But the via ferrata was something else. I look back at those pictures and I'm like... I still can't believe I just did this! And again... it's something like 1.5 KM, they give you 5 hours. At the beginning, our group is like, ""Any chance we can crank this out in 2 hours?"" Our guide be like, ""We'll see."" Well... 5 hours later, we're reduced to whiny toddlers.

 Some comments:
- better do Targoviste and Pitesti as a day trip from Bucharest
- instead of Balti, it would be more impressive to visit the giant wineries on Chisinau's outskirts
- from Sibiu do a day trip to either Corvin castle or to Balea lake in the Fagaras mountains
- from Brasov do a day trip to the nearby old German villages with fortress churches (Prejmer or Harman, for instance) and some hiking in the Bucegi or Piatra Craiului mountains

 Other hikes: Roque Nublo of course, Las Tres Presas, and the hike over the mountain to Playa Guigui. Hiking the dunes of Mas Palomas is another experience altogether, and much more tiring than you might think.

 also i think it's probably better to plan trips like this around ""what's the best thing to do"" in europe based on your interests rather than ""what are the best cities to visit"" because you'll miss a lot of things if you're just going to hit budapest, prague, rome, etc.

Reddit,Am I trying to do too much? SEA+EU in 4 months,_mchn_,"I am one of the few people who actually like Jakarta, but it's useless for travelling. There are no traditional sights, relatively little to do, and it has some of the worst traffic outside of cities like Dhaka. Skip it, Indonesia is two months minimum, you either ditch Europe or Jakarta.  
 Thailand is nice and all, but dedicating the most time to the least interesting and most touristy country in the region is not a great idea, I would cut it down to a week of a quick Bangkok trip and a few days on the beach partying (I guess that's part of the reason why you would go, because Thailand doesn't have world class sights like Angkor or Bagan) and add the remaining days to Vietnam, that way you could do North to Central or Central to South at your own pace.  
 Seven countries in two months is somewhat doable in Europe if you pick the right countries, but definitely not in Asia, you would miss out on way too much.  
 Focusing on Vietnam and Cambodia would be a much nicer experience, I promise you.  
 The second big decision is whether to split the trip and go to Europe or to stay for four months. Most people on this subreddit would say stay, but I also understand that not many people have as much free time to travel as people here.  
 In that case, my only recommendation would be to select your experiences carefully. Please don't fall into the typical first time in Europe trap and run around the London-Paris-Amsterdam-Barcelona-Prague-Rome-Athens trail then wonder why it cost so much and why haven't you met any locals ever and only been herded into tourist restaurants for two months.  
 Try to map Europe similarly as you would the US, keeping in mind that it's much more densely populated over here and you have historically important towns and cities at least every hundred mile. Back home you wouldn't attempt to visit Alaska, Florida, New York, DC, and California on the same trip, right? Same applies here.  
 In two months, you can see a good amount in the Mediterranean, for example, Portugal to Southern France is perfectly doable. You could also focus on Central Europe and the Balkans. Or the west, BeNeLux, plus France. Or the UK and Ireland. Also, after SEA you will probably want to cool down, so Iceland plus Norway can be nice, but you will need a lot of money and a very different wardrobe.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1q4zjix/am_i_trying_to_do_too_much_seaeu_in_4_months/
Reddit,Am I trying to do too much? SEA+EU in 4 months,3rd_in_line,"Accounting for a couple days of flexibility, this would roughly bring me to May, as which time I would fly to Eastern Europe and work my way west on via train, spending 4-5 days in some major cities on the way (figuring out the route once I'd get there) until it is time for me to head home. 
 
 What do you really want to achieve on your 4 month holiday?  Just spending 4-5 days in major cities in Europe and figuring it out on the way is going to turn out to be a bit of a waste.  Cities will start to feel similar and you will get sick on the same old thing. 
 You need a goal or a list of things you want to achieve.  You have listed Jakarta for 5 days - I can't think of anything you have seen that has made you consider going there.  Is there something you want to do there?  9 days in Cambodia, for what? 4 days in Siem Reap and 2 in Phnom Penh and then? Are you aware of the visa requirements? 
 If you have unlimited money, then 2 months in each of Asia and Europe is doable, but Europe will be multiple times times more expenses, especially for July.  But you have to limit your time in each of these places and just do what you really want to do (not doing things just because you have been told that is what you should be doing).

Reddit,Am I trying to do too much? SEA+EU in 4 months,KindergartenDJ,"Hi ! European living in Asia and solo traveler, my own, subjective take : 
 -"" I feel I am falling into the trap of trying to see too many things on this trip"" : yep ! 
 -""Is 2 months SEA and 2 months in Europe feasible?"" : it is, but you should sort your priorities. See point 1. 
 As for now : 
 Asia plan : you are wasting too much time in between airport. Your time is precious, why do you want to spend so many hours in plane ? 
 Japan-Seoul (5 days) : ok sure, Seoul has a lot to offer. Can't comment too much, have been there once only.  
 Then, Jakarta 5 days : don't get me wrong, I like Jakarta and Indonesia. A lot. In fact, my next trip will be there. But I wouldn't advise anyone who just travel (I work remote, so basically I work during the day in Jakarta, great nightlife so it is fine) to spend 5 full days just visiting Jakarta. Unless you have friends there. 
People are great but it is a bit of an urban hell, and not the best place for wandering around. If you still decide to go because you enjoy weird metropolis, then check Pasar santa and bars such as Duckdown.  
 KL-5 days: going to Jakarta AND KL is a bit too much big city hopping ? Albeit KL should be cleander. I dunno though, impression from afar (hard to beat Jakarta's messy side anyway) and I will check in March on my way back. Check Rumah Api.  
 I would recommend chosing either Indonesia or Malaysia, and checking another city. Like, you can do Jakarta and Yogjakarta (for the Javanese culture), or Kuala Lumpur and Penang or Mallaca. Just to do more than barely scratching the surface of the capital city.  
 Vietnam 12 days  : ok but where ? dont tell me just Hanoi and HCMC lol 
 Thailand 21 days : same, that's better because 3 weeks so finally can have some depth, but where, when and what ? I did 50 days last year, mostly in Isaan region. 
 What s your Europe plan ? If you keep moving around every week or 2 weeks, you will get tired after 2 or 3 months and I think you will rather spend 1 month in one country for your last montgh, perhaps divided in two places. I would recommend to travel a little bit slower and more cohesive, but I also understand your FOMO.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1q4zjix/am_i_trying_to_do_too_much_seaeu_in_4_months/

Reddit,Need tips for a week-long trip to Scotland,ani_svnit,"Hey, can def help with public transit travel as that's how I have seen most of Scotland. 
 Firstly, time is not on your side with just a week and 2 of those days in Edinburgh as public transport travel is slower. Eilean Donan makes a lot of sense combined with Skye as its next door and I personally think its a decent castle. 
 So my overall suggestion would be to use the remaining 5 days to choose an island, see it a bit and make way back to Edinburgh with a stop. Do consider Rabbies as an alternative to public transport - its  3 day from Edinburgh  covers a few of your listed highlights and faster than public transport as the latter is centered around Glasgow not Edinburgh 
 Public transport option 1 for Skye: Edinburgh - Glasgow (by train) - Portree Skye (by direct Citylink bus) - Fort William (ideally Ferry + Train) - Glasgow (by train, West Highland Line is a must) - Edinburgh. Use Skye Scenic Tours on Skye for day trip. 
 Public transport option 2 for Mull: Edinburgh - Glasgow (by train) - Oban (by train) - Mull (Calmac ferry) - back to Oban (ferry) - Fort William (bus) - Glasgow (train) - Edinburgh (train). Take a Staffa Trips boat if season has begun or check West Coast Motors website for all in tour from Oban

Reddit,Solo travelling tips for France,Nicky_AtPolarsteps,"I love France and have seen loads of the country, including two road trips a long time ago. I think almost everywhere is worth seeing. The trains are really good for connecting you between cities (eg. Paris to Marseille is 3.5hrs). The roads are also really well maintained, but that's because you have to pay tolls to use them (and this can add up to be expensive). It might be a good idea to hire a car to explore some of the regions, using the B roads more than the motorways. That way you can see villages and areas of nature in between the cities, but get from city to city without wasting too much time. For example you could drive from Toulouse to Nice and beyond along the south coast roads, stopping at places like St Tropez, Antibes, Marseille (MUCEM is amazing), Carcassonne, Nimes, Aix en Provence, Montpellier... You could extend either side of this route into Spain (down to Barcelona) and Italy (down to Florence), there are trains that connect through.   
 Lyon is lovely and very foodie. You could also hire a car to explore the Alps from here, including Grenoble, Annecy, and Aix les Bains, and do some hikes in the mountains.  
 I'd skip Bordeaux unless you know loads about wine or are particularly into wines from that area. Remember everywhere in France has local wines that are delicious and well priced. Bordeaux wines are more expensive and the vineyards are more touristy. I like Toulouse better, it's a friendly and beautiful southern city and if you hire a car, you can explore Dordogne from there (up to Sarlat la Caneda).

Reddit,Does it seem like it’s a crime to travel these day?,jswa77,"There are a lot of different ways to travel and unfortunately a lot of people want to go to the same marquee spots like Mexico City, Barcelona, Rome, Cancun, Tokyo, Bangkok, Paris Etc instead of smaller, cheaper and in my opinion often times more beautiful cities and towns. This influx of tourists into a fairly small number of cities really distorts the economy of a city. If Airbnb is left to run free, you often have a huge number of apartments/houses that turn into short term rentals which raises housing orices for the locals substantially.  
 If you own property or a restaurant, etc., in one of these countries, you can actually really benefit from all the tourism, but that’s a tiny fraction of the population so you get most of the citizens with rising cost of living a city choked with tourists where they can’t go to the restaurants and bars they used to love and be able to get into easily. Now anything that’s special in a Capital city is projected all around the world on Instagram and TikTok etc.  
 The real trick is going to the smaller cities and the countryside for cheaper everything, often friendlier locals and less other less tourists. You get a more singular experience of the culture of that one area with its cuisine, topography, history etc instead of a capital city which often incapsulates the whole country but at the cost of absolute authenticity.",3,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q5ppon/does_it_seem_like_its_a_crime_to_travel_these_day/
Reddit,Does it seem like it’s a crime to travel these day?,SplitOpenAndMelt420,"I think this comes down to specifics- 
 I live in Los Angeles , so there are always Tourists here, but I don't see them because they are typically at just  the tourist attractions. In a large city like LA or New York or London or Tokyo or Paris, the tourists blend in and become a working part of the city 
 Now take Kauai, or the Isle of Skye in Scotland (both places I've traveled to many times). 
 Small or isolated places with small populations where the tourist numbers are usually higher than the local residents.  
 Many people in these places are priced out of their homes or the ability to live where they were born, due to the tourist industry. 
 At the same time they rely on it entirely so it's a real mixed bag for locals, I'm sure.  
 So as an Angelino, I don't care about tourists at all and I'm not aware when I interact with them really, whereas I've traveled to many spots around the world where you can tell it's 95% tourists and 5% the local population who is forced to engage in the tourism industry to make a living and to be able to afford to stay in their homes

Reddit,Why Padang (West Sumatra) and the Mentawai Islands Should Be on Your Indonesia Itinerary,Mongol_Jamboree,"I just took a three week trip after 3 years of having West Sumatra on my bucketlist. Overall I think the province was great. I kept a little polarsteps diary of my trip in case anyone is interested in what I saw and what my thoughts were (just send me a pm) 
 However I can think of a few reason why tourists in general opt for other places like Bali, Thailand, Vietnam etc in SEA. 
 The biggest elephant in the room is religious conservatism. As far as Indonesians go, Minang have become some of the most religiously conservative people in Indonesia and for tourists that might mean not feel comfortable especially if they're a woman. Generally, as Arab modesty ideas have gained traction, a consequence in some places are men who seem a bit more leery and ill-intentioned. I should say I'm a Male but my wife did feel uncomfortable in Maninjau with the way some men were behaving even with me around. Indigenous traditions tend to be considered more exotic by tourists (Buddhism, Hinduism, Animism etc.) which also draws people elsewhere as West Sumatra (outside the Mentawais) doesn't have much left of its pre-islamic heritage. 
 The second thing that i think draws tourists away is wildlife. While some enigmatic species remain in West Sumatra, elephants, rhinos and importantly orangutans are locally extinct so it's understandable tourists go to North Sumatra or elsewhere instead. 
 This isn't intended to besmirch the region and West Sumatra is still maybe the 3rd most touristed province on Sumatra. There's great nature, lots to do and I could have easily filled another 3 weeks in the province had I had the time.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1q62eqh/why_padang_west_sumatra_and_the_mentawai_islands/

Reddit,My top 5 fav vs top 5 worst solotravel destinations,BRCityzen,"Great post. With 50+ countries under my belt, people often ask me best and worst, but it's hard to give an answer because everyone's travel style is so different. Best for what? Adventure? Food? Culture? Nature? Romantic getaway? Solo travel? Singles trip? Partying? 
 And it's hard to say what's worst. I research pretty thoroughly where I go, so I rarely actually *dislike* a place. Otherwise, why go? That said, there are places that just exceed all expectations, and places that, as much as I wanted to like them, were just disappointing. And maybe not an entire country either. 
 A few in the first category, in no particular order... 
 -Brazil. Brazil is like my new favorite country at least right now LOL. Spent a week in Rio and it was surprisingly not enough, and I didn't even have time to go in the water once! Sao Paulo has such a vibrant food and nightlife scene, can't wait to go back. The Pantanal is everything travelers think the Amazon will be, but isn't. OTOH, 4 days in the Amazon itself was enough. And Brasilia, though it had been on my bucket list, was really disappointing. As much as I admire Oscar Niemeyer the man, I found that I don't really care for his work. 
 -Indonesia. My wife wanted to go to Bali specifically. And if it was just Bali, Indonesia would be on the second list. But we both agreed that literally every other part of Indonesia was amazing... except Bali. 
 -Vietnam is just a dream. Beautiful country, and so easy to meet people. Don't think I had a single bad experience there. And yes, I agree you can get top class accommodations for cheap. 
 -Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan has not one, not two, but three UN World Heritage cities, all connected by Chinese-built bullet trains. And they are real gems. Especially Kiva. After hours, once the trinket sellers have closed their stalls inside the walled city, you're basically transported into the time of the Timurid Empire. And the capital Tashkent is no slouch, in spite of what some say. Among other attractions, it has one of the finest Soviet metro systems outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
 -China. Been several times, and each time I'm more impressed than the last. The tech is next level, but it's also a country with 4000 years of history and multiple cultures that it does a great job of preserving. Not an ""easy"" country to travel in; don't expect to speak English, and it's a proud country that bows to no one. But that's just fine. 
 A few in the second category... 
 -Slovenia. I really wanted to like it. Lake Bled was a bucket list item. But after seeing it, I'm like... so explain how this lake is more impressive than Lake Merritt right here in the SF Bay Area where I live? And Ljubljana just felt small and provincial. 
 -Crete. Again, we were both looking forward to Crete, because we loved other parts of Greece so much. But the beaches are windy, the cities were mid, and the Cretan cuisine (which we were sooo looking forward to)... well we just never really had a memorable meal there. Rhodes, OTOH, I would put into the first category. 
 -Buenos Aires. If you don't eat steak, the food is just terrible. Even if you do, it takes some getting used to going to a restaurant, ordering a steak, and you get... steak. That's it. Nothing else. If you're lucky, they bring you a side of chimichurri the size of your thumb. At least it was all really cheap... except not any more. Prices under Millei's ""reforms"" have gone through the roof. The glaciers in Patagonia are phenomenal though. 
 -Kiev. Ok, maybe I didn't do it justice. I was staying with people and relied on them too much. Perhaps I should've explored more on my own. But I came away thinking, for a city of 4 million people, is this really all there is? And that was before the current conflict. It was 2011, a new president was just elected, the ugly nationalism had (temporarily) died down, things were more hopeful then. I wouldn't suggest going there at all right now. 
 -Copenhagen. It's like a Disney version of a European city. After a while, you've had enough of the palaces... and the smorrebrods, which are all basically similar. Even supposedly freewheeling Christiania has been tamed. The pot sellers are gone, the trinket sellers have now taken over. It's the most conventional and orderly ""anarchist"" community I've ever seen.

Reddit,Balkan roadtrip recommendations,SkembeCorba,"If you're going to Macedonia, you cannot miss the lakes, mountains, and ruins. 
 Ohrid lake is incredible, and the drive around it is filled with natural and cultural sites to see. The old town of Ohrid alone, including the ruins and winding cobblestone streets, is worth the visit. Make sure to stop there and walk around it. 
 Beyond the town, the lake itself is a natural wonder; super clear, calm, and deep. Tons of natural pebble beaches are around and, if you're into this, a tons of hidden ones you can hike down from cliff sides. Specifically, there's a spot along the road from Ohrid city to Sveti Naum called ""Veli Dab"" (you can find it in Google Maps) with a small parking area that serves as a viewpoint. You can hike down there to one of these beaches. It's my favorite! 
 Sveti Naum monastery is amazing too; is a Byzantine-era monastary built at the Crni Drim springs. The monastary itself is really picturesque and impressive (early center of Slavonic literacy), but the springs are just as impressive! The water there comes ""filtered"" through the mountains that separate Prespa and Ohrid and comes out extremely clear. To the point the water there gets bottled as holy water. There are trails that allow you to hike around the springs.  
 From Ohrid you can also explore Galicica if you like hiking; the mountains there create and isthmus that separates Ohrid from Prespa. The views and air are incredible. 
 That alone could be a wonderful vacation, but if you want to explore more of Macedonia you should check out Pelister national park (from the Prespa side), Mavrovo national park, and the other major archeological sites (Heraclea Lynkestis, Stobi).

 Downstream of the Vardar river is also Macedonian wine country and is home to Stobi. If there's one Hellenistic site to visit, I would recommend that one. It was one of the two capitals of Roman Macedon. Most of it is still unexcavated but the early Christian mosaics are beautiful.

 Tbilisi I have found to be largely the same as back home. It's just a City Thing™ I think 
 Cities out in the west of the country tend to be chummier and friendlier. Kutaisi, Batumi, etc. I think the reputation for Georgian hospitality originated in Imereti. But I've experienced it in Kvemo-Kartli, and surprisingly, even in Gori 
 Generally the mood here nationally has turned a bit sour over the last couple years and everyone is feeling crummy, but ways to keep the mood up are to speak as much Georgian as possible in interactions everywhere, and to deploy the tried and true ""Ar vitsi rusuli, da ar minda vitsode"" whenever someone tries to talk to you in russian.

 We are not even American nor do we expect people on the street to roll out a red carpet for us lol. 
 And it’s not a “big city thing”, people were much nicer in NYC, Paris, Tokyo, Instanbul etc. Once again, I was there for a month and did the entire country. As a whole, the people were unpleasant and shitty. Even talking to people who were not rude to us, they would only be negative and cynical. For reference, at the time Turkey was going through a huge financial inflation issue, and 98% of people were weirdly upbeat and friendly. After Georgia went to Qatar and Korea where everybody was also extremely nice and helpful to us (strangers on the street, people you meet at bars, service staff etc.). We also saw lots of Georgians being rude to other Georgians (and fighting) as well and seeing them get aggravated at being treated like that. It’s just a cultural issue.  
 In my party, two can speak Russian and Ukrainian and my partner and I made sure to interact with as many locals as possible. Were some nice? Sure, but overall (once again I have been to over 30 countries), they by far had the shittiest people. Constants scam attempts as well (especially when they thought we could only speak English). 
 The thing I’ll leave you with is I was clearly with my partner and we would get hit on occasionally. I would politely declined direct sex propositions (by ugly men 15-20 years older) and then they would start to cause a scene and threaten to attack me and start puffing their chest etc. This happened at least 3 times in person and 20+ times online.

Reddit,Travel experience in Georgia 🇬🇪,boomfruit,"This is a good assessment. The problem comes because people hear about Georgian hospitality and expect to experience that from every asshole on the street. No, the famous Georgian hospitality does not comes from toilet attendant and sellers at the bazari; it comes from people when you are in their home, which truly could happen in many situations. It also comes when you are embracing and appreciating Georgian culture, especially the language. 
 To be frank, it also seems to come when you have some link to the people, so it's hard because millions of tourists come with no link whatsoever and expect this hospitality they have heard of which was built up through centuries of traditions, but most likely related to travelers who weren't just going to Georgia on a whim for a week, people who stayed for a long time, and who felt and remarked that Georgians made them feel at home. 
 To me, it seems like a problem of marketing. Tourists seem to hear about the Georgian hospitality and think it means that it will be like a resort, where everyone in the country is living to serve you, smile at you; life revolves around you. In reality, Georgian hospitality is about how welcoming Georgians are  when acting as hosts  specifically, ie when you're in their houses. 
 My background: I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Georgia, so I lived there for two years, spoke Georgian decently past the first few months, at least for a foreigner. I am also white, just to be clear. I cannot count the amount of times that literally random people would invite me into their homes, or just stop to have a genuine and friendly conversation when they realized me and my friends could speak Georgian, while out in a village or in the mountains or whatever. And that's not to mention that many many times I stayed with the families of friends of mine and they pulled out all the stops for a supra. And  that's  not to mention the way my host community embraced me. At the same time, I had hundreds of interactions with bored cashiers, taxi drivers who wanted more money than they would've gotten from a Georgian, waiters and restaurant staff who wished you weren't there. None of that has anything to do with the Georgian hospitality.

Reddit,Travel experience in Georgia 🇬🇪,incogfool,"First and foremost, I'm so sorry that you and your fam had so many bad experiences in Georgia. As a POC myself I can empathise only too well with how debilitating it is when ignorant bigots resort to racism as a means to put you down. It's unacceptable in any context, and I totally understand your feelings about the country as a result.  
 Having said that, I'd like to offer a counterpoint for other Brown/Black travellers thinking of heading that way. 
 I was there in Sep 2024 and had the most incredible time. Had plenty of wonderful interactions with locals, including effectively getting 'adopted' by the family that ran one of the guesthouses I stayed in (I ended up extending my stay purely because of them). I was treated with kindness and respect in every place I visited, to the point where it's one of the countries in the world I'm most eager to return to. 
 To be fair, there was one instance where the issue of race did rear its ugly head. A couple of travel buddies that I'd made on the road wanted to go to a club in Tbilisi, and after doing a bit of research I found myself concerned by their door policy whereby they basically 'screen' you before allowing entry. You're placed in front of a camera and then wait for some weirdo gatekeeper in some unseen room to give you approval or not. I hate door policies anywhere tbh, but this one seemed particularly problematic as I'd read reviews from numerous POC saying that they'd been refused entry and had suspected it had sth to do with skin colour. 
 I tried my luck anyway and was allowed in just fine. But I also spoke to some Indian students in the adjacent bar (sans entry policy) who definitely seemed to be treated as 'lesser' by the locals, and who didn't even try to get into the club based on their past experiences. 
 So my impression of the country is that racism and hostility certainly exists, and is likely more palpably felt here than in many other regions of the world. However, that was not what  I  experienced as a Brown solo traveller who's deep into his 30s and very well-travelled (including across the former Soviet nations). My takeaways are the hospitality and warmth from people across all walks of life, the spectacular scenery, the delicious veggie food options, and so. much. wine! I'd say it's definitely worth the risk for my fellow POC travellers, but I'm just one experience in a sea of many, and I recognise that others (like OP, sadly) have vastly different ones that are just as valid.

I would factor in at least a couple of Ubers though which might make it expensive. If you haven’t booked flights, why don’t you do SF - LA - Vegas. I would add time in SF to drive outside the city to Napa or Monterrey. LA you can skip downtown and maybe add a hike and Hollywood sign.

Sign up for a lot tour or to be part of a studio audience which some people consider gimmicky, but you are visiting LA for a reason. I don’t enjoy Vegas but it is an experience. Your plan sounds a bit hectic but I don’t think you need to spend much longer there. 
 If you want an alternative to Vegas / Grand Canyon and you like exploring cities, Seattle is lovely… although much nicer in the summer.

Reddit,Summer trip to San Francisco,tariqabjotu,"But that person is not doing the same thing. Like, sure, if you want to do exactly two things – go to a redwood forest on the coast and go to a sequoia forest inland – it would make sense to stay midway between those points and make a day trip to one on one day and a day trip to the other on the other day. Those drives are both 4+ hours round trip, so it doesn't sound like a fun trip, but that  is  indeed the most efficient way to accomplish that. 
 However, that's not what it sounds like you want to do. It sounds like you want to spend most of your time in San Francisco and the immediate surroundings with just an excursion over to Calaveras Big Trees State Park. Even if you were to go to Calaveras – which I would recommend against – it doesn't make sense to stay midway between there and San Francisco when you want to spend the majority of time in San Francisco. 
 And note that even the OP in that post, who made no mention of visiting SF (unlike you), decided to focus on one of the big trees.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q7ln1g/summer_trip_to_san_francisco/

 Don't rent a car for days you stay in SF. You won't need it, street parking can be obnoxiously difficult, and garage parking is typically expensive. Just rent it for the days you want to make excursions. If public transit is not enough for you within the city, just take an Uber or a Waymo. 
 Muir Woods is the easiest and most popular way to see redwoods when in SF. The park uses entry reservations nowadays. Make sure to book it in advance.

Reddit,Looking for a destination with easy access to both food and nature,BCRobyn,"Banff is still very much full-on winter until early June. There  is  a good food scene, but it’s also 100% a tourist town. The population is only about 8,000 and it’s largely made up of international students on holiday working visas, working in the service industry to cater to the millions of international visitors who come every year, mostly between May and October. Only go in March if you want to ski. 
 Have you considered Vancouver? 
 It has a climate very similar to Seattle and Portland in March, so it won’t feel wintery. It’s usually mild, green, and lush, and March is cherry blossom season, so the city is full of blooming trees. Vancouver is a serious food city, especially for authentic Asian cuisine and local wild Pacific seafood, but also great farm-to-table spots, bakeries, coffee, craft beer, and wine. 
 It’s also extremely diverse and very comfortable for LGBTQ+ couples. An interracial lesbian couple wouldn’t stand out at all there. 
 And it’s genuinely a city built for nature lovers. The Coast Mountains are right across the bridge from downtown (home of Cypress, Seymour, and Grouse, though there will still be snow in the alpine), and you’ve got ocean inlets, beaches, waterfalls, and temperate rainforest parks like Stanley Park and Lynn Canyon all right in the city. You can be in real forest within minutes. You also don’t need a car to enjoy most of it. Public transit is good, it’s very walkable, and it’s a really nice place to just wander and let the days unfold. 
 If you haven’t been before, it honestly checks every box you listed. And March is shoulder season, right before the Alaska cruise ship passengers arrive in April and drive up hotel prices.",5,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q7e36l/looking_for_a_destination_with_easy_access_to/

 Tofino and Ucluelet are small west coast villages a 40 minute drive apart with Pacific Rim National Park situated between the two. Same sort of energy as the Olympic Peninsula/La Push area. Super transcendent spiritual nature kind of place.

The Itria Valley is full of those ancient round huts called trulli. You would need a car, but from a central location like that many of the amazing ancient cities aren’t far — Bari, Monopoli, Polignano a Mare, Ostuni, to name a few, and of course Matera. Puglia has two coasts, in my experience the west coast has more beautiful beaches. In the north of Puglia there’s Gargano National Park, which I’ve heard is beautiful. Bari and Brindisi have airports. The Pugliesi trend to drive fast, but I’ve driven there as a Non-Italian a few times with no problems lol. The food is great there.  
 My favorite towns to stay on the Costa Brava are Callela de Palafrugell in the south and Cadaqués in the north. The Costa Brava might be easier if you’d like to try without a car because of the proximity to Barcelona. The whole coast is beautiful with a lot of hiking trails. Up by Cadaqués there’s the Cap de Creus, a wild and gorgeous peninsula with bizarre geological formations. Further inland Girona is a really interesting city. As well as Figueres and Besalu. The Pyrenees Mountains run down to the sea along the border to France and there’s great hiking not far from the sea, for instance up above Port de la Selva around  the Monastery of Sant Pere de Rodes.

Reddit,Malaysia Trip – Itinerary Check & Advice Needed,Upper_Kaleidoscope11,"Hi fellow Malaysian here here are my suggestions:- 
 D3
- you can do petaling street and jalan alor back to back as these places are generally more lively at night and the whole KLCC area is walkable
- Brickfields would be more suitable for the day as at night it tends to be a little more dodgy and depending on what time you go some if not most shops would be closed 
 Day 4
would recommend you stop by rexkl and pasar seni (both of these are relatively close to each other) rexkl is an old cinema that is used as a an art/event space with a really cool bookstore and pasar seni/ central market has a lot of cultural things and/or events happening usually
- around pasar seni there are plenty of airbnb and/or hostels (if you have the budget more expensive hotels) and if you are open to walking a little (around 4km/ish) KLCC is around and you can check it out at night as they usually have waterworks shows (jalan alor is also closeby so you can return back to try more malaysian food) 
 As someone else recommended in Penang the heritage culture is very prominent, they have the largest UNESCO world heritage city and it is generally walkable all around (they have a heritage trail you can follow) and the food culture in Penang is pretty good too. Would recommend Penang Hill if you can as you can see the whole outlay of Penang (island and mainland) and the historical part ie where colonial officers used to stay in Penang can be seen (it is a little pricey around rm200 to go on the private observatory deck) 
 Hope this helps",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1q75t4p/malaysia_trip_itinerary_check_advice_needed/
Reddit,Malaysia Trip – Itinerary Check & Advice Needed,Cojemos,Don't understand why you'd go to the trouble of going ALL the way to Penang for 1 night. You're A city know for food and some of the better food in Malaysia. And why would you stay near Batu Caves when it's an easy drive/ride from KL? Think people often have this idea that short flights doesn't take all day or at least half day. I see it as a travel day and not a visit day. Sure you can get some things in but by the time of checking in and having to check out it's 1 day'ish. And the malls get old real quick. And Suria is one of the least interesting other than being connected to the P towers. Chinatown isn't all that either.

Reddit,"Which is better, Georgia or Bulgaria?",Prestigious_Risk_781,"Been to both multiple times and I would choose Georgia over Bulgaria - I am on the cultural aspect side of the group. Partying - Bulgaria is better (but neither are really great) - Georgia makes the claim as the first peoples in the world to make wine so wine is everywhere and it is pretty good.  
 Questions: Cost - Georgia is insanely cheap; it was wild. And the food was so much better. Khachapuri and lobiani OMG mouth is watering thinking about it. Food was not great in Bulgaria, like they didn’t season anything, now at Christmas time they have the chimneys which are great but I that isn’t specific to Bulgaria as much as the Balkans in general. 
- Culture: I would say they are both unique and it is fun to see and experience. What I can say is this - the people of Georgia were so welcoming, we had several invite us into their homes for meals, to show us around, to take part in festivities. It is a country on the poor side so that should be understood to begin with. Bulgaria, we felt like they were watching us the whole time - as Americans/English speakers they were always a little hesitant. Nature - Georgia hands down - the mountains, the monasteries in the hills, the rivers and waterfalls, the coastline to the west in Batumi. Incredible. Bulgaria isn’t bad by any means but Georgia was just so much more. 
- Nightlife - Bulgaria. Varna or Sofia have more to do in that respect. Tbilisi is cool, but not for nightlife; and Batumi is touristy as a beach resort area.  
 So, we have been to Bulgaria twice and Georgia three times. We drove into Bulgaria the first time and it was sketchy, they were not exactly nice. They actually pulled e to the back to question me; held us for a few hours. The second time we flew into Sofia and it was smoother. The first time we drove into from Greece on a road trip and stopped in Sandanski before making our way north to Sofia (and cutting across the country to Varna); it I was a beautiful town with a strip of restaurants and shops along a river. But we got stares and when we spoke with people they didn’t really want to talk to us. We sat at a restaurant and I just remember it being so bland. Wasn’t a good start. Things got better in Sofia and out to Varna. But just never sold us. The second time, flew into Sofia for a weekend there; just to give it another go. It was okay.  
 Georgia; flew into Tbilisi twice and drove to Batumi on a big road trip from Turkey (border was sketchy on the Turkish side on the way back but not into Georgia). Out the gate the people were so friendly helping us out, giving us directions and offering rides. We did a lot of just driving and hiking in the mountains the first trip. In Kazbegi, we went up to a monastery and stopped in the town on the way back; a family saw us and invited us to a get together they were having. So much food and so fun. It was like that a lot of places there. Gori we got invited over to dinner with a family, they showed us their grapes they grow in their backyard to make wine then let us try the wine. And I have to say it again, Khachapuri is so freaking good. I called them cheese boats - they are like eye shaped bread with rolled crusts, in the middle is a a bunch of cheese, once it comes out of the oven they put stick of butter in (they are big) and an egg. Because it is hot, the egg cooks a little. But you take the crust tear it off and dip it in the center mixing it up. So good.",7,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q7s2rx/which_is_better_georgia_or_bulgaria/

Reddit,"Which is better, Georgia or Bulgaria?",Prestigious_Risk_781,"I was in Georgia about the last time about a year ago. October-November 24. It had gone up but was still fairly cheap. We go to Georgia a lot because we have a good friend who owns an apartment in Tbilisi but lives in the US now so her parents take care of the apartment and they use it when they are in town. I was talking with her husband about how cheap it was there, and he said it used to be insanely cheap compared to the US; but it has gone up. I remember the first time I went, I went with just my son to explore; I called my wife to tell her about how much a paid for things - I remember getting like two three scoop ice creams in cones and two cokes for $2; when I travel I don’t like bags so I try to purchase amenities on the other end, and I got everything I needed along with some t-shirts and cheap shorts for like $10. It blew my mind. Also, hahaha, I pointed out to my friend, they really like Wendy’s out there - like they are heavily advertised. She told me to go check it out because it wasn’t like in the US; they had pizza on the menu. Then the McDonalds was like an actual restaurant, with a hostess and a waiter - I don’t know if they are all like that there, but the one we went to was. My friend said when she got to America she was so upset that McDonalds was so dirty and trashy because it was like a high-end restaurant there.  
 Bulgaria, the last time I was there was in 2023. They weren’t as cheap as Georgia. The Balkans in general are cheap but not on the same level as Georgia.  
 Georgia, if you want to do the whole country, you need at least a week but to fully experience it 10-12 days. They have ancient caves in the south, lots of hiking and mountains in the north; beaches out to the west. We never stayed in a hotel, but they looked nice enough. The time we stayed in Batumi we did an AirBnB and it was awesome; it helped make us feel like we were really there. The owners didn’t live far and they brought us bread and wine every day.  
 Just a side note, the Balkans are absolutely amazing. If you did Bulgaria and you had a lot of time, I would highly recommend a road trip through the Balkans - though be prepared with your documents at the borders for some places. North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, Croatia, all of them are incredible (of course, Greece - my favorite). If you were to pitch it as a road trip through the Balkans, I would probably choose that. But if it is Bulgaria or Georgia, I’d choose Georgia.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q7s2rx/which_is_better_georgia_or_bulgaria/

Reddit,"Which is better, Georgia or Bulgaria?",UnhappyScore,"So I stayed just short of a week, but I am also a very fast paced traveller (I get bored in a single place easily). I also travelled solo, which means I can do more in a day. I visited Tbilisi, but also hired a car for my entire stay, which meant that i was able to visit Castles & Fortresses on the drive to Kutaisi. Kutaisi itself isn't as interesting as Tbilisi but was a handy stop on the way up to the mountains (Zemo Svaneti National Park) where I spent a day hiking near Ushguli, then also staying there a night. Highly recommend making it up to this part of the country if you can. 
 Tbilisi itself is a beautiful city and theres lots to do there for a few days, but I would highly recommend getting a car and seeing some of the sites around the country. I believe there are organised tours too if none of you want to drive, and whilst they were obviously tourist prices, they still werent too bad imo from what I saw. 
 Some highlights I saw were: Didgori Battle Memorial, Drisi Javakhaant Castle, Ananuri Fortress Complex, Gori (Fortress & Stalin Museum lol), Skhara Glacier & Ushguli. If you can manage to stay over a week, I think that would be ideal, and you could pick out a handful of spots to check outside of Tbilisi. 
 Edit: Oh and due to a uhhh cashflow issue I was stuck with about £100 spending money for the week, including fuel for the car lol.

 I didn't stay on a Felucca overnight but none of the Feluccas that I saw in Aswan looked like they were places people stayed overnight. I don't recall seeing any out on the Nile overnight, but I wasn't looking closely. There are cruise ships that are much larger than Feluccas that could be stayed in, but otherwise I'd expect you to just ride a Felucca during the day, and if you want to be on the Nile multiple days, look into a cruise.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q83fpq/egypt_trip_2025_spend_10_days_loved_it_heres_what/

Reddit,Weekend Trip Ideas from NJ to LA,alextoria,"ooh i like this prompt! my home airport is lax and i do lots of thursday-sunday trips bc i work monday-thursday, and i have done a couple trips where i meet up with east coast or florida friends in the middle-ish. for such a short trip i always like to choose something with a nonstop flight. are you guys into nature or would you rather stay in a city? want to get away from the cold? rough budget?  
 some ideas: 
- national park - i’ve done this one multiple times. in feb/march i’d look at zion or grand canyon, flying into vegas or phoenix
- caribbean - i already know off the top of my head all the nonstop flights from lax to the caribbean lol it’s only cancun, belize, or grand cayman. cancun is great for a couple days at a resort, belize is amazing but prob deserves a full week, and grand cayman is great but more expensive and focused a lot on diving. i’ll also throw miami or key largo in the mix here, fun for a couple days. 
- central america - lax goes nonstop to guatemala, costa rica, and panama. amazing destinations but it takes time to get around, so i wouldn’t do them for a weekend trip. 
- cities - mexico city, albuquerque, idk where else feb/march is kinda awkward timing and it really depends on if you’re ok being really cold!",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q72h3n/weekend_trip_ideas_from_nj_to_la/

They do not really care about the everyday life of people there. Pakistan and India are seen as rivals, and these creators know that anything involving both countries brings attention from both sides. 
 With Pakistan, it is easier for them to play it safe. Pakistan already has a better image in the West when it comes to natural beauty, landscapes, and “hidden gem” travel content. So they focus on hospitality, mountains, food, and kindness, and avoid controversy. 
 If they openly take sides with India, it becomes controversial very fast. There is already a lot of bias in Western audiences, and honestly, even many Indians face negative stereotypes there. These vloggers do not want to be associated with that kind of backlash, so they avoid it completely. It is a calculated move, not an honest one. 
 I am not denying that some good things about Pakistan are real. Of course they are. But a lot of this content is selective, simplified, and designed for engagement, not truth. It is more about branding, algorithms, and views than actually understanding the region or the people living there.

There too, laws are different for different strata, just the way it happens is nuanced. Similarly many developed countries are corrupt but they are not characterized as corrupt because their laws legalize corruption or nuance it. 
 I find the struggle in Pakistan, a Muslim country, synonymous with being a Muslim. Struggling to make it a better place for myself and society where possible. Just like how Islam doesn't see financial progress as an important factor, I too don't think much about it at all.  
 That's why I am ok being dirt poor, just like right now, all my bank accounts are empty. It has been like this on and off for 7 years now. All this to achieve my goal which is going to happen this year. All my effort is going to give fruit. 
 Pakistan has extreme potential, I completely disagree that coming out of poverty is almost impossible for anyone. Unless of course you have made powerful enemies and you didn't have the will to give up, accept humiliation for a better tomorrow. We will get justice in Qayamat, regardless.

 But do you not think this shit happens literally everywhere? I’ve had shit like that happen to me in at ghetto ass places here in the US it’s just how the world works.  
 You don’t need to fault people for wanting something to feel good about and hospitality is at least something that’s relatively achievable for a country as undeveloped.

 I have seen tons of overseas Pakistani youtubers who go back to the streets of Karachi, and give local vendors a ton of attitude, asking them if they accept $$ instead of ruppes and what not. 
 If I am running a hospitality company or are a street vendor, it is in my best interest to be accomodating to non-Pakistanis, as a booming tourism sector will be exponentially well for my own bottom line, and everyone recognizes that. Unfortunately, around 99% of total tourism is done specifically by the overseas Pakistanis, so everyone is more than incentivize to treat non-Pakistanis with extra care. 
 After all, Pakistan is a pretty decent place to travel when compared to places around Asia that have a similar HDI index (South East Asia for example), they get to rake in big $$$ off tourism, while we are left with pennies on the dollar. 
 Further, Pakistanis are extremely hospitable as a culture, ofcourse, we recognize the country is not at the same level as say, Norway, but that doesn't mean folks won't be pround of who they are.

 My in laws came to a busy restaurant in Karachi (1 hr wait) and because they were from abroad (Arab), they cut the line for us, it’s treating tourists with respect and giving them great service. It’s not bending backwards. 
 You are right to point out issues in Pakistan, corruption, crime, poverty, but these are issues that need to be tackled. It’s not fair to ignore the good Pakistan has either, the people are genuinely very kind.

 And nope. I am not generalizing. That's the ground reality of India. Scamming is the norm, stealing from foreigners is the norm, abusing is the norm. Kindness is an exception. 
In Pakistan it is the opposite. Kindness and hospitality is the norm, but there are a few exceptions in which foreign tourists may have been scammed. So it's not generalization. I recognize the fact that there might be exceptions.  
 And nope. You need to get your facts straight. Do you know how huge North India is? And do you know how many ethnicities North India has? Do you even know that North India has Tibetan ethnicities? What the hell do the Tibetans have in common with Pakistanis? Again, the only commonality between North India and Pakistan is the Punjabis. Punjabis represent only 3% of India. They are a tiny minority.  
 Similarly to India, North Pakistan as well has diff ethnicities. Other than Punjabis we have Kalashis, Chitralis, Pashtuns and Gilgities. What do they have in common with Endians?  
 Stop this bs. Fr. We are not the same as Endians and stop forcing this association, and can you please respect the fact that majority of Pakis do not want to be associated to Indians even subjectively?

That's why statistical data is important, anecdote is just a story. 
 And by saying  ""scamming is the norm in India and kindness is the exception"",  you describe a default behavior for 1.4 billion people, that is exactly what generalizing means. 
 On ethnicity: When I say ditto, I also generalized, my bad! My point is that most of the culture and society is same between Pakistan and North India. 
Pointing out minority diversity (Tibetans, Kalash, Pashtuns etc.) doesn’t refute the fact that large parts of North India and Pakistan share history, linguistics, and culture.

I can afford my own apt, car, travel money and live somewhat comfortably. My friend in Pakistan who also did CS barely make enough to even move out of their parents house.  
 I love Pakistan as well, especially my childhood in an islamic country and would gladly move there once i have enough retirement to live off that comfortably without needing to work full time. Especially considering how the US is now. But its also better to be honest. Besides the money reasons which make getting a house, car and other electronics much cheaper here, there is also quality of life that you are not considering. 
 Comparing US to Karachi where i am from, you dont have gas, water and electricity outages. You dont have to deal with tanker mafia, traffic police extortion, low quality goods and services with no course of legal action, dhakkas and rishwat at any govt offices etc. Also, a lot less nosy neighbors and family who have lots of very strong opinions here.

 While visa and other stuff goes on, aim for C1 from Goethe and then when you get here, try to enroll for B1 classes, you will have to pass an assessment and depending on your level, they might place/recommend you in B1, B2 or C1, but this is a faster route.",0,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1q891oz/want_to_move_out_of_pakistan_but_really_confused/

 Alexandria was founded by Greeks and is a Greek city. Cleopatra ruled there and her statuea and those of her dynasty are casually found in many locations.  
 Not to mention that the length of Egyptian civilization was longer than the entire Roman empire. 
 Add onto that the history from the Middle Ages. Egypt has historic sites from periods when Rome was just farmland. Which they tell you about when you visit Rome, id youve ever done that. 
 Ive been to both and Rome is a let down. Most of the sites are reconstructions or they dont have much to see. The Italians rebuilt the ruins during the rise of Fascism as part of the hearkening of rebuilding the Roman Empire.

 Egypt is a dictatorial police state. If anyone bothers you, get a police officer. Shout ""POLICE!!"". This is not LA. This is not Morocco. In Egypt the people are legitimately afraid of police in a manner more similar to North Korea. 
 From my own observation, Egyptian women have more rights than Italians or Greeks. Women work everywhere. Theyre on the bus and working the stores you will shop at. Theyre educated and many speak English. 
 The issue these people have is going to bad areas of town. The pyramids are in Giza, which is a world class shithole. Imagine if the worlds biggest tourist trap was in the worst part of Baltimore. Khan el Khalili is a shitty market in one of the poorest parts of Cairo.

 I get it, it isn’t perfect. And no trip there will be perfect even if you follow every tip provided over the hundreds of posts. But your chance of having a successful trip with minimal issues are improved greatly even if you may not like executing the tips.  
 People downvoted the “then don’t go” comments basically act entitled to go and change and behave how they should and expect to be able to and not be harassed or scammed etc.  
 “Let women wear what they want”…is ridiculous. Would the same people say “let homosexuals show affection every country they go to”? 
 At the end of the day you are visiting their country. Take it or leave it. People just react to this because at the end of the day, if they had the chance to go, they would go in a heartbeat because Egypt is one of a kind place to visit in terms if sites. You can wait for their culture to change or not.  
 I can say I felt very safe there. Locals do not mess with tourists from a safety standpoint at tourist sites. I didn’t feel as though I’d be threatened or pickpocketed etc. I felt more unease in Barcelona with pickpocketing or safety in South Africa.

I had just broken up with my girlfriend and my housemate was off to Krakow on a lads trip, I only vaguely knew one or two of them from a poker game or two. Someone dropped out and he said if I just bought a flight, everything else was covered. I am not a laddy guy. Our friend group was super mixed and I was just as likely to go to the pub with 4 girls as 4 guys, so the lads holiday thing was not appealing at all. But I really wanted to see Auschwitz so we agreed me and him would do that while we were there. 
 These guys were absolute wankers it turned out. Like I truly hated half of them within an hour (in hindsight my housemate is not really the guy I thought he was either). They were just there to cheat on their partners and go to strip clubs 
 So, given all that, I should have hated Krakow. But the city itself was great. Once we escaped the group and just went to bars, I met so many lovely people and the city is fairly pretty 
 But I cannot stress how much you have to go to Auschwitz. You will never experience anything like it; it's horrifying, it's fascinating, it's eye-opening and it will stay with you forever. I weirdly came out of it feeling strangely positive like ""oh this is how awful humans can be and we generally manage to not do this"".  
 Poles are great too. They will act like they hate you until they've decided you're alright, and then they are so dark, so funny, really nice (I'm British so obviously have a humor bias for this)  
 Budapest is really nice, you'll have a great time there but seriously, Auschwitz is like the opposite of a Wonder of the World, like a Horror of the world, possibly number 1, and you should grab the chance to see it, it will be a tiny part of you forever",3,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q6l8a7/krakow_vs_budapest_for_a_guys_trip_in_february/

Reddit,Planning First International Trip for My 62-Year-Old Mother (India → Japan) – Looking for Advice,Capable-Toe-9841,"Japan can be quite hilly. A walk may only be 5 mins on the map, but be up an extremely steep hill. If you stay in traditional ins, you may have a futon, which means sleeping on the floor. Depending on her knees, she may have difficulty getting up and down from this, and it will be an especial nuscence if she needs to go to bathroom in the night. If this will be a problem for her, ensure she has a ""western style bed"". Some traditional restaurants will also be seated on the floor, so check the seating situation before entering. Squat toilets are traditional in Japan, although there will almost always be a ""western style toilet"" available somewhere. Best to not wait until desperate before going to the toilet as she may have to wait a little longer for a western style toilet at places like temples where they may only be one. 
 Lots of temples will have steep stairs. 
 I would recommend booking tours for much of this. Even if you don't have a whole package tour, having just a day tour that picks you up and drops you off at the hotel may help a lot to limit how much walking up and down stairs/hill your mum is doing in transit so that she can save her energy for the things she really wants to see. Some of the temples, gardens and museums are huge, so there'll be plenty of steps in those alone. 
 Taxis are very reliable if you want to do this option too. The only reason I recommend tours is that the tour guide can discuss with you the demands of the tour when you make enquiries and arrange adjustments if possible to make her more comfortable. 
 I have known people who have travelled to Japan with young children to find it very exhausting on them. 7 is sort of an in between age as to whether it would be too taxing or not, so it may be beneficial for your daughter as well to have these tours.",8,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q8yr1i/planning_first_international_trip_for_my/
Reddit,Planning First International Trip for My 62-Year-Old Mother (India → Japan) – Looking for Advice,MoodyMango4880,"A lot of the temples in Kyoto have a lot of stairs but the Japanese culture is very respectful to senior citizens so you may get help.  
 I found I walked around 25,000-30,000 steps a day there. Distances, especially in Tokyo are further than you think. So you should plan day trips and make use of taxis and transport to get between places so she can save her energy for the sites. 
Plan in lots of rest breaks. It’s very easy in Japan to rush from one site to the other.  
 Osaka is a modern city (also your son will love universal) and worth doing for 2 days in addition to Kyoto and Tokyo. In Kyoto try and visit monuments super early as will be cooler and quieter (the crowds can be crazy).  
 I loved Hiroshima also for a couple of days. Worth doing a day trip to Miyajima island for the nature - your mother can get the cable car up and down the mountain.  
 The Shinkasen rail is a great way to get around. We also forwarded our luggage so on the train had only small bags for 2-3 days worth of clothing. Really easy to do from hotels and reasonable pricing.  
 Tokyo is huge. I recommend staying in 2 different areas to minimise travel to sites. Maybe first part in Shibuya / Harajuku area and then second part near Ginza.  
 The metro in Osaka and Tokyo is really easy to use and even though escalators can be tiring and lots of walking. Especially Tokyo so bear that in mind for your mum.",3,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q8yr1i/planning_first_international_trip_for_my/

Literally countless hundreds and hundreds of millions have gone before you. That means Thailand's tourist infrastructure is highly developed for budget western travellers so there's countless great hostels everywhere that tourists visit. You have loads of excellent choices. 
 Bottom line, Thailand is the perfect place to ""learn"" how to travel so you've made a good choice. That said you don't need three months there. Since it's your first trip continue along the Banana Pancake Trail through Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc. Once you develop some confidence there's lots of opportunity to get off the beaten path and away from the foreign hordes. 
 Riding a motorcycle illegally means your Emergency Medical and Liability insurance is invalid. Don't do this, period. An under 50cc scooter falls into a grey area, confirm directly with your travel insurance what coverage they'll give you. 
 Border runs aren't necessary. You have up to 60 days in Thailand. Your E-Visa for Laos is 30 days, same as Cambodia. You're Visa Waiver up to 45 days for Vietnam and their E-Visa is good for 90 days. You can easily travel around without border runs.

Everybody who's been to Thailand has great things to say about it. The food is unbelievably delicious & the locals are friendly. Bangkok has something for everyone, if you want a cheap hostel for under $15 you can get it. If you want a luxury hotel with a rooftop swimming pool, you can get it and for a jaw dropping price.

As another comment said, convenient to Columbia and also the Statue of Liberty is kind of impossible, except by being on a west side subway line. The subway makes it easy. Over the years our preference for where to stay has changed. Now we nearly always stay in lower Manhattan. Midtown and the financial district have the widest options for nice, but relatively affordable hotels. But the financial district is a little calmer (by NYC standards anyway) than midtown and less taxing to walk around in, find a nice place to eat, enjoy the East River and Hudson River, and of course this is where you'll have easy access to the Statue of Liberty. It's true that you'll have to hop a subway to go see a play uptown, hit the prestige museums, or visit Central Park, but the trade-off of less intense noise and crowd density is totally worth it. After a long day visiting places across the city, getting back down to your hotel room in FiDi feels almost relaxing. I recommend The Artezen, the Indigo (FiDi), and Cloud One as clean, modern, pleasant, and reasonably priced options.

 Everyone has the usual feedback, but I think this is an important highlight. 
 There is no ""right"" way to enjoy or learn about a city. It sounds like you're setting up a lot of expectations, and then struggling to reach them. Tourist traps aren't necessarily evil. Being overcharged isn't necessarily a death spiral. Stuck in traffic, missing an attraction, ""consumed in the technical stuff"", none of these are necessarily trip-ruining. 
 It's really telling because you're asking ""what things you have to do"" and ""things you absolutely avoid"" and ""find the spots to go"". There are no absolutes -- plan to your preferences and enjoy it for what it is. Don't fret the things you missed, don't worry about things that didn't go great.  Do  learn from them, of course, for next time -- but don't let it ruin the trip. 
 Some people here are planners, others are wingers. Some travel solo, some travel as a pair, some in small groups, others in tours. Some go with hostels, some go with 5-stars, some go on cruises, some go on all-inclusives. It's not going to be productive to ask an open-ended question to this giant swath of people and try to merge the feedback. You need to find what  you  want to do. 
 Same flags with  
 
 what are tips you could give from the best trips of your lives where you felt the magic of the place and really got to make memories that stick and make connections that last and just really enjoy your time 
 
 Not every trip is going to be the best trip. Not every place is going to make you feel ""magic"" or even make ""memories"". What works for you is  unique to you , so don't worry as much about these lofty ideals, start traveling and figure out what  you  enjoy, and do more of that. And if you don't achieve them on a trip, that's  fine . Such is life.

Some trips are for relaxation andlying by a pool reading and going to the spa, and some are for being more active. Some are for seeing multiple cities at a time and others are staying in one place.
I was surprised at a recent trip that was centered around visiting my friends and family and my extremely well-traveled boyfriend ended up saying it was the best trip of his life! I was surprised because he missed some of the activities as he stayed behind to attend a major sporting event in the area, or to simply walk on the beach.

Reddit,Seeking advice on how to enjoy travelling,Estesp,"I always choose a topic for each trip. Let’s say food for Japan, Beer for Belgium, Coffee spots for Australia, and so on. Then I also choose one main activity to be the “Peak” of the trip, the thing I’m looking forward the most (that can or cannot be related to the topic). For example, staying at an onsen in Japan or going to a fancy dinner; running across race in Sydney. This “Peak” activity at around 3/4 of my trip duration.  
 Then, in Google maps use the save tool to add all the places related to your trip topic that you COULD go. For me that’s the key thing. It’s not a checklist, but places I could go. Then set 1-2 main spots to visit each day, ideally close to one another, and try to put your topic places in between if you’re in the area.  
 The process with my partner usually goes like this: hey let’s go run a race in Sydney, we will stay in hotel X for 1 week. Then she will send hundreds of reels for places I will save in our map. Then together we say on Day 1 we go to the Opera, Day 2 to the Zoo. On our way from hotel X to the opera, we will have breakfast at reel 1, then stop at coffee reel 2, and so on.

Reddit,Seeking advice on how to enjoy travelling,4SearchingInfo,"One of the things that will make travel less exhausting for you is the organization around it. 
Get some compression bags and a good toiletry bag from a place like trippedtravel.com and pack lighter. Arriving exhausted and already hassled, potentially forgetting a key toiletry and then not knowing where to find a place to buy it once you're there, all those kinds of things create unnecessary stress and detract from the experience.  
 Pre-pack a toiletry bag and leave it packed for your next trip, only having to add things like your eyeglasses and prescriptions at the last minute. 
 Once you are at your hotel, designate a particular place on the corner of a table or nightstand for keys, hotel room card, and your wallet, sunglasses, the things that you would be walking out the door with. It makes coming and going easier and you feel more in control. 
 As for budgeting and getting the most out of the experience, this is why in this day and age people still use travel advisors. Unless they are planning a specific  itinerary for you, generally they do not charge a planning fee, as hotels and rental cars and excursions pay their commission. You are paying for it anyway, these places simply pocketed if they don't have an advisor to pay the commission to. You might as well take advantage of the service. If you want them to plan the itinerary it might be $150 to $300 well spent. They help you determine what you want to get out of your travel experience and then how to achieve it. Why you were going to a certain area and why one city might work for you better than another, or how to find the activities that you will enjoy in that area.  
 Some people love reading about where they will travel and doing all the planning themselves, but not everybody has the time for that, or even knowing where to begin. You will see me get a torrent of hate from people on here who feel that they can plan their own travel, but every single person on this Earth is different, and you do what works for you and let them do what works for them. It is a good place to start, until you get the feel for what questions to ask yourself and what might lead you to where to even research to get the most out of each experience.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q98b0f/seeking_advice_on_how_to_enjoy_travelling/

Reddit,Seeking advice on how to enjoy travelling,Fun-Title4224,"I recommend the book The Art Of Travel by Alain de Botton. It's a light philosophy book about travel that might give you things to think about. It's very readable and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  
 For some people travel is just ""go somewhere warm, swim, eat, read, rest"". And for that you just need a nice hotel somewhere. Nothing wrong with it, but it's not for me.  
 But really, it's about finding the things that spark your curiosity. For me, travel is curiousity. What's it like there? What does that look like? What do people do here? Where did this come from? How is that different? What is the food like? How does the language sound? What is the architecture like? 
 It's about being somewhere so different that I don't have to think about my ordinary lifem  
 To get started in exploring, think about what you like. Do you want to walk in nature? Do you want to people watch in a city? Do you want art? Or history museums? Do you like bars and music or somewhere quieter? Do you want something busy and bustling, or quiet and charming? Do you want the coast? What sort of weather? 
 Then pick somewhere for 2 or 3 days. Don't over-plan. Let's say you want to go to Paris. So think, well, I'd like to go to the Eiffel Tower and the Musee d'Orsay. Fine. That's enough. Off you go. When there, don't have a timetable. Don't march from one place to the next. Don't always get the metro - if something is close, walk. Slowly. Go where your curiosity takes you.

Put that money in a separate account and don’t touch it until you need to pay down the trip or book flights. Taking $ each paycheck and have it direct deposited into a savings account really helped us start saving for trips.,1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q98b0f/seeking_advice_on_how_to_enjoy_travelling/
Reddit,Seeking advice on how to enjoy travelling,JanetInSpain,"Lessons we've learned over many years of travel: 
 
 Choose a place that is interesting TO YOU, not just someplace that's popular. That can really vary. Do you like history? ANCIENT history? Architecture? Hiking in mountains? Beaches? Choose a place that makes you go ""ooooo!"" rather than a place to check off some ""must see"" list.  
 Pack light. You don't need a new outfit for each day. Lugging a giant suitcase around is a real mood killer. You can rinse undies and lightweight tops in your room, or take a couple of hours and visit a local laundromat.  
 Slow down. Don't try to do a new city every 2-3 days. A two-night stay is only one day in a city. Stay at least three nights and four would be better.  
 Don't overplan. Don't have a minute-by-minute agenda for every day. That said... 
 Don't underplan either. Have a list of places you'd like to see or things you'd like to do in a city, but not a detailed schedule of WHEN.  
 Also don't miss the secrets. Check sites like Atlas Obscura to find out the offbeat, unusual, and little-known-but-cool things to see and do in a city. 
 Stay eat in the mega tourist areas. You'll find cheaper and tastier local foods if you go off the beaten path a bit.  
 Explore. Get lost even. We like to hop on a bus or tram and get off on a random stop then look for a nearby cafe. It's how we discovered the Cemetery of Pleasures in Lisbon and an amazing wooded park full of trains on the northern edge of Brno Czechia. 
 Don't be afraid to just sit and watch the world go by for a bit. Don't run from place to place all day. Stop at a cafe and get a coffee or glass of wine. Take in the ambiance of the place you are visiting. 
 Be resilient. Something will almost always go wrong or not work out. View those as opportunities to regroup and do something different. Museum you wanted to see is closed on Tuesday and that was your only day? Go visit the local botanical garden or find one of those tiny, obscure museums (like we found the Butter Museum in Cork because it was too stormy to go to Blarney Castle). Don't let a forced change of plans ruin your day. 
 
 Have fun! Take your time.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q98b0f/seeking_advice_on_how_to_enjoy_travelling/
Reddit,Seeking advice on how to enjoy travelling,North_Possession5363,"think a lot of enjoying travel comes down to letting go of the idea that you have to do it “right.” The trips that stick with me most are the ones where I had one or two loose plans a day and let the rest unfold naturally — walking a lot, sitting in cafés longer than planned, talking to people, and not stressing if something didn’t happen. I usually pick one thing I’m excited about and build the day around that, then leave space for wandering, because that’s where the memories tend to come from. Budget-wise, I decide in advance what I care about spending money on (usually food or experiences) so I’m not constantly overthinking every decision. I also try to avoid rushing between attractions or cramming too much in, since that’s when travel starts to feel like work. For me, the magic comes from slowing down enough to notice how a place feels, not just what it has.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q98b0f/seeking_advice_on_how_to_enjoy_travelling/

If you do Mexico and hit all the places you mentioned, it will take many days to do them justice.

 I can not speak authoritatively to safety in Mexico but I do think that if you stick to the better parts of CDMX in the day time, and be VERY careful after dark (ideally with others you trust), you should be OK. There is a lot of street life in the artsy areas, it is a lot of fun to walk around. 
 It has the risks of a large cosmopolitan city, but I don't believe the cartels are there. Those might be an issue in some of the other places.

Reddit,"First solo backpacking trip to Thailand, need tips and advice",Kananaskis_Country,"You're going to the most popular budget backpacker destination on the planet and that has been the case for decades. Literally countless hundreds and hundreds of millions have gone before you. That means Thailand's tourist infrastructure is highly developed for budget western travellers so there's countless great hostels everywhere that tourists visit. You have loads of excellent choices. 
 Bottom line, Thailand is the perfect place to ""learn"" how to travel so you've made a good choice. That said you don't need three months there. Since it's your first trip continue along the Banana Pancake Trail through Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, etc. Once you develop some confidence there's lots of opportunity to get off the beaten path. 
 Riding a motorcycle illegally means your Emergency Medical and Liability insurance is invalid. An under 50cc scooter falls into a grey area, confirm with your travel insurance. 
 Border runs aren't necessary. You have up to 60 days in Thailand. Your E-Visa for Laos is 30 days, same as Cambodia. You're Visa Waiver up to 45 days for Vietnam and their E-Visa is good for 90 days. You can easily travel around without border runs.

Personally I love Ortigia, it’s probably my favorite place in Sicily, the food is great the vibes are high, super beautiful, walkable, it’s all the things. I would avoid anything but aperitivos in the cafes overlooking the bay, go into the town to find restaurants, it’ll be worth it. I’ve not been to Caltanissetta, but if you’re open I’d recommend 1 night in Noto, very close to Siracusa and super beautiful. If you want to see San Vito lo capo and scopello you could keep the itinerary but alternatively you could extend your stay in the egadi islands. It’s about an hour ferry from trapani, maybe a bit more. Favignana is a great place to rent a bike and just go slowly around the island, you can also go to Levanzo or Marettimo which are much less developed and great for relaxing. The water will probably be a bit cold for swimming then but there are tons of hikes and great food options on the islands. Alternatively consider Cefalu instead of the egadi islands, someone below hated on it and I agree it can be a bit much but not in mid May. It is legitimately beautiful and worth seeing.",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1q8tjp4/sicily_itinerary_help/

 Would highly suggest checking out some of the beautiful forests directly on the route from SF to LA by car - Big Basin Redwoods State Park (can find banana slugs there too - pretty unique fauna), Pfiefer Big Sur State Park (stunning place as well), or spend a few hours at the beautiful Monterey Bay Aquarium, and good wineries at Paso Robles.

Reddit,"Mid-August California trip (SF → Sequoia → LA) – crowds, traffic, where to stay?",WarthogImpossible999,"Thanks to both of you, I totally get the point about efficiency and I agree that  PCH / Big Sur is an amazing road trip . 
We did consider it seriously. 
 That said, we’re coming from Italy, and seeing  giant sequoias  is something we  really  want to prioritize — trees like that simply don’t exist in Europe. 
We’re aware Sequoia means more driving, but we’re ok with that trade-off and with  seeing only the main highlights . 
 Our idea is to use  most/all of Friday (Aug 14)  just to reach the Sequoia area, stay near the park, and visit Sequoia  early on Saturday , then continue toward LA. 
 What I’d really appreciate is some  local insight  on: 
 •  Traffic expectations on Fri Aug 14  (SF → Central Valley → Sequoia area) 
• Whether traffic into Sequoia on  Saturday morning  is manageable if entering early 
•  Best route to take  from SF to Sequoia (even if slightly longer) for less traffic or more scenic driving — I’ll use GPS anyway, but locals often know better alternatives 
 We know it’s not the most efficient option, but for us it’s more about  this specific experience  than covering more stops.

Reddit,"Mid-August California trip (SF → Sequoia → LA) – crowds, traffic, where to stay?",Sovva29,"Different responder here, but as a local I don't think your current plan is bad.  
 Friday traffic shouldn't be too bad for you as long as you are out of the city before lunch time. Most folks try to leave work early on Fridays to do their mega commutes back to Central Valley. That would be my only concern. 
 Sequoia on Saturdays is always popular. The earlier the better; no later than 10am to avoid entrance crowds. 
 I can't say much about a route in, since I usually rely on my GPS, too.

Reddit,"Mid-August California trip (SF → Sequoia → LA) – crowds, traffic, where to stay?",mapleaddicts,"Agree with the other poster. Sequoia is not worth it considering the amount of driving and time. You are better off doing PCH down to LA after SF. Take a trip down to Carmel by the Sea and Monterey, visit Hearst Castle, stop by Dinosaur Park Bluffs along Pismo Beach, hit Santa Barbara Zoo, hike the Venutra Botanical Gardens near sunset for stunning views, stop at the Sandy Dunes & Malibu Pier, maybe drive up the Santa Monica Mountains into Calabasas if you're into since there are great sunset spots overlooking the ocean, and drive into Santa Monica (free parking after 6PM at any metered spot or because it's winter, parking lots are discounted) and enjoy the beach. 
 Sequoia is nice, but tbh, hitting things along PCH as someone who lived in LA and went up PCH all the time is way better if you're doing a roadtrip.

CA is a very large state, much bigger than it looks.  Driving will be majority of your day just getting to LA.  Tulare/Visalia has nothing to offer, other than a hotel.  Being completely honest.  And, the commute getting from SF to Central Valley no time is a good time.  Doesn’t matter what time or what day.  I’m an hr from SF, but can take 2 hrs because of traffic.  Thats just getting to and from the CV.  Getting to Sequoia, sounds miserable with kids in the car.  The temps in August in Tulare/Visalia is HOT.  Do factor in the weather.  Have you considered going to Tahoe? Much better weather, beautiful drive.  Or driving the 101 getting down to LA.  Avoid Central Valley/Tulare/Visalia/Fresno area.  Seriously, nothing worth seeing.  I’m a Cali native when we have family/friends coming to visit, we hit Tahoe, Carmel, San Diego, zoo, Legoland, Disneyland, Universal Studios, things like that.

I actually did a similar drive almost 20 years ago (SF → Las Vegas), going through the Central Valley, and I agree — it’s basically flat and not scenic at all. That trip was in  May , though, so weather-wise it was much more forgiving. 
 We did consider  Lake Tahoe , and I personally love the idea, but in this case it doesn’t really fit our route since we’re flying out of  LA  and trying to avoid backtracking too much. 
 We’re fully aware that August in the Central Valley will be  dry and very hot , and that most of the day will be spent driving — that’s part of the trade-off we’ve accepted to be able to see the giant sequoias, which are pretty unique for us coming from Europe.

Reminded me of my Ecuador trip in 2018. Quilatoa and Cotopaxi were the 🐝 🦵 for sure. I used Wanderbus for my tour - it was FANTASTIC. My guide became a close family friend whom I still talk with this day and have stayed with her family on return trips. Love Ecuador so much.  
 I second the long bus trip mistake/experience. Suuuuper cheap but it's a LONG trip because of the stops, as you mentioned. For perspective of a non-tight budget, when I went with a friend, we liked our taxi driver in Baños and ended up hiring him for all our travel needs, including getting to Cuenca (~4-5hr drive by car vs ~8-10hr by public bus and $8-$12). We split the $300-$400 cab fare and added extra time in Cuenca we really needed on our 7day trip. It allowed us to explore Cuenca upon arrival and have the whole next 2 days for museums and Incapirca ruins. We paid for our taxi driver's hotel ($15-$20) and he drove us to Incapirca the next day (1-1.5hrs one way). We also paid for him to have dinner and breakfast with us. Again, he was chill and super cool. Again, not extreme budget friendly, but for two solo female travelers with 2 bags each on a 7 day trip, we spent the extra $ for certain perks. Public transportation is great too, just for different scenarios.

Reddit,Here's why I lurk here,WoodpeckerNo7169,"As the other person replied to you, Pakistanis has moved on from this particular mindset. I would also like to add that clips we often watch coming out of your news channels are very event specific. If they will show you a clip of politician or Army individual talking about your country or making a patriotic speech centric to your country, than it's most likely happened after the military escalations like May and that's it.  
 Our political campaigns are far from it. I don't know about the specific clips I watched (quiet a few on social media actually) in election campaign saying stuff about Pakistan, are event specific or happen generally in your country's elections but our politics have not been India centric for a long time. Also almost all of the Army pressers or them interacting with public outside of event specific gatherings, the main focus is terrorism wreaking havoc in our country at this point.  
 The general sentiment is well nothing. People don't care about India much in general discussions. It only come up when explicitly mentioned like street interviews, and all that. From Indian point of view, the  Kashmir issue could be seen as expansionist sentiment I suppose but as always perspective matter. 
 Our narrative do not revolve around Kashmir being integral part of Pakistan unlike India and even older generation in Pakistan where slogans like, ""Kashmir Pakistan ke Shah Rug hai"" were main narrative. It's more in the direction of, Kashmir belong to Kashmiris and they should be deciding thier future and nobody else. Also we didn't change their status from administered areas so in a hindsight our stance cannot be translated to expansionist ideals. 
 Our main narrative is well defense of Pakistan from everyone who seek to harm it and not just India. And there are more pressing issues like TTP, BLA, some other proxies terrorizing the common people and so on. India was becoming more of a backdrop threat when faced with so many challenges before May attacks because this generation especially the GenZ had not seen the peak tensions of Kargil or 2000 border skirmishes but I guess there are changes in our mindset how we precieved India before May and after. 
 For me personally, I was against (like any sane individual) the escalations and war like situations. And you might be aware of the the people's narrative against military after they basically deposed Imran Khan and did all the shit show of elections and electoral theft but when missiles were flying over my house a civilian area with no connection to any thing Indians were saying on TV (targeting terror outfits), it became clear that without the Army, I might be one of those who were killed in those attack, along with my family and people I loved for nothing. Just a casualty for the sake of piling dead bodies more than the other sides. It was quite eye opening and my perspective did shifted. 
 And your PM literally threatened every Pakistani by saying that either eat bread or my bullet. Munir's statement that we would take half of the world down with us came after such statements and I am content that we nukes and functioning army unlike many countries who became rubble and ashes or basically have thier social fabric torned to pieces. Incidents like Kashmiri villages of Kunan and Poshpura are reminder that it could be us if not for the defense we have at the moment. We don't want to spread Islam or expand but if there is an attack on our sovereignty well at least we have something to push back as long as we can.",5,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1qa0du2/heres_why_i_lurk_here/

 If you want both city and nature, Ljubljana is going to be your best bet. Easy to do daytrips to pretty much anywhere and the nicest city from any of these imo.  
 If you're prioritising nature, I'd do Dolomites because the rifugios are very convenient and there are a number of towns in the surrounding areas. A rifugio gives you a bunk bed and half board for around EUR35-50 per night if I remember correctly. If you hike rifugio to rifugio, you don't have transport costs, but the region has good trains and buses.  
 Prioritising nature in Slovenia is better with a car which I assume you don't want to hire.  
 Croatia is more doable without a car if you stick to Split + Dubrovnik and do island hopping + boat tours.  
 In summary: 
 Dolomites for gorgeous mountains and easy hut to hut hiking. Not much in the way of things to do in the surrounding towns. 
 Ljubljana for a good mix of city life + daytrips into nature.

Reddit,Suggestion for first solo travel,arimuGB,"I’ve been there twice — first time was only for a few days as I was on my way to Taiwan. 
 The second time I was there for 3 weeks. Met loads of Australians — got the impression it’s a pretty convenient destination for you guys if you want to travel a little further than Indonesia. 
 If I had to boil my entire trip to one experience, it would be Miyajima (just off the coast from Hiroshima). If you Google Image search it, you might recognise the main Torii gate immediately (in fact I think it’s the main Wiki image for “Torii shrine” lol).  
 It’s sounds very touristy — and it is during the peak tourism season (March/April) — but it’s quite out of the way for it to still be bearable and pleasant. It has a mountain trek called Mount Misen (only 535m), which funnily enough none of the Instagram tourists bother with, and has a cable car if the climb/climb down looks challenging. I was personally spent after the climb, so the cable car back down was like an answer from God. 
 I also just found Hiroshima to be a very special place given its history, and to see it thriving from the top of Mt Misen on a sunny day was quite profound. With the sun at its highest point in the sky, it’s not too difficult to image the split-second moment of an atomic bomb would look like and the scope of the devastation there.  
 That being said , and while it’s great to have a few focal points on your trips to aim for, my fondest memories of Japan are actually the in-between moments. Darting in and out of the Combini shops for a quick snack. Navigating around Shinkansen stations. Attempting broken Japanese to the locals and having them smile because I made some effort to use the local dialect. They really appreciate this stuff, because the bad tourists really have made a name for themselves.

 I like more rural travel rather than city destinations. I have found smaller towns have been some of my best trips and most unique experiences. 
 I'm in the US and have found some of my most rewarding travel to be within the US. That being said, I know with a shorter trip staying in Australia may be a good first solo trip. My husband and I went to North Queensland for a couple of weeks in 2019 and loved it. There is so much to explore in our own country, we forget that it is still a unique and amazing experience. Again US experience, I have found that each state has its own culture. The easiest example is that California is very different from New York.

A good hotel will do a very good buffet breakfast. Even mediocre hotels do a pretty decent breakfast.  
 If you go in summer, then take the ferry tour from the dock by the central station to the Viking museum on the island of Birka. It's an hour or two of cruising up the inland lakes, a few hours at the museum, and then cruise back. While you can eat at the museum I actually recommend bringing a picnic (you get easily get good portable food in the city) and then taking the guided tour of the island, which takes you past the important things and then leaves you to walk back or picnic or do what you like. Book ahead. 
 There are many cultural things to do, especially in summer. There's a whole row of museums with the Nordic museum, the Vasa, and several others. Sundry galleries. Outdoors events of various sorts. Simply walking around the old town looking at it. Some high end food if that's your thing.

Reddit,I guide tours in Morocco. Stop treating everything like a scam.,Hunter7890,"I was in Morocco a few years back. We wanted to make a trip out to the desert so we contacted someone local who could book that trip for us and we ended up booking a few other day trips through him. One of the day trips he had planned was to the Atlas Mountains. Last minute he had to swap out the guide taking us, so it wasn't one of his regular guides, I'm thinking he would hire some freelance guides here and there when needed.  
 We didn't pay that much attention to the specific itinerary for the day before we left but apparently, we were supposed to go visit with a Berber family and have tea (maybe breakfast too).  The guide missed this stop, and on the way back to Marrakesh he asked if we knew about it and we said we weren't really sure.  
 Shortly after he pulls the car over and starts talking to a kid across the street in Arabic, he gestures to us and says ""Canadian"". The kid nods, takes off and we follow him back to his house. The guide and the kid take us inside, and we sit on a couch. The guide then goes back to the car while the kids' mother (I assume) made us tea. It was awkward with the language barrier and a little uncomfortable once we realized we were just in some random person's house. I have no idea if the guide gave them money, we did leave a bit on our way out.

Reddit,I guide tours in Morocco. Stop treating everything like a scam.,-snowpeapod-,"This is very true. The country isn't just a playground for tourists where bad faith scammers roam, it's a place where people live out their lives and have all the same interactions, hopes and dreams everyone else in the world does. A few things I've learned from my years backpacking around the world: 
 
 Consider how you appear from the perspective of the locals. If you're visiting a country with rampant poverty, you are actually very wealthy, even if you're average back home. 
 Dress modestly and pay attention to local norms. It automatically earns you more respect. For example, in many Asian countries only children wear shorts. A full grown man wearing shorts looks ridiculous and you'll stand out like a sore thumb. In India, women show their belly but that doesn't mean showing other skin is acceptable, in their culture the belly isn't considered ""exposed"" as it is in Western countries, but showing leg or even shoulders is risqué. 
 you can ignore touts without being a dick. Just say ""no thanks"" then ignore them. If you're confident and firm, they'll realise they can't convince you and leave you alone. 
 try being a human to vendors, ask them about their day, their family, their lives. They aren't robots just looking to make a buck and often the mask comes down pretty quickly if you show interest in them as a person. I've also been invited for tea and shown their nicer products and offered better prices because of this! 
 Slow down!!! Don't fill every day of your trip with activities or sightseeing. Take some time to just wander and sit and observe. See what real life is like in that country. 
 No matter how different a place is, how alien a different culture feels, kids are the same everywhere.",0,https://old.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1qb0x06/i_guide_tours_in_morocco_stop_treating_everything/

Reddit,Advice for a quick trip to France,L6b1,"Train tickets can increase in price dramatically the closer you get to your travel dates. So while you're traveling in the off season and to a lot of places that are less touristed in general and are unlikely to deal with sold out trains, you may find that it's cheaper to purchase tickets now rather than waiting to purchase the  day of. Note, this isn't the case for regional/local trains, but is the case for longer distance and high speed trains (Frecciarossa, TGV, etc) 
 Renting a car that is allowed to go through multiple EU countries can be cost prohibitive as you might have to pay 2 or 3 times the normal daily rate and the associated costs with leaving the car at a different drop off point than the pick up location is eyewatering in the off season (in summer it can be free due to demand, in the winter the fee usually starts at 150 euros).",1 point,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qa35av/advice_for_a_quick_trip_to_france/
Reddit,Advice for a quick trip to France,kinnikinnick321,"How about asking some of the family you have in the cities you're visiting what their take is?  Could they have a parking space for you to use or suggest if you came by car where'd you park?  Differs vastly if they live deep in the city center where even driving the streets may be a real pain or if they live on the outskirts where 20 cars can park within 50 yards of their front door - which leads to, are you going to stay with them or in your own accommodation?  From my experience (having both rented and taking trains throughout Europe), one of the decisive factors is parking availability.  Denser cities like Paris or Nice where parking may be a challenge, I would just rely on local public transportation. 
 Having a car does have it upsides for the more rural areas to explore countryside villages/markets and being able to bring along luggage without a sweat.  I'd suggest bundling the more populous cities together where you can and take local transport, use the car for inter-country travel to explore and make the best of it.

Reddit,Month-long solo journey to New Zealand (South Island) late Feb-March. Looking for perspective,Peregrine415,"68 years old, traveled solo to the South Island in April 2024, and going back in late April 2026. March in NZ will still be daylight saving time, warm during the day, but the leaves will start to turn, if not already. My advice is to ditch the camper van, hire a car, and stay in hotels. There will be days when you just want to chill, enjoy a bottle of wine, do laundry, etc. I stayed at a cottage in a vineyard in Cromwell toward the end of my trip, and it was a great way to wind down, recharge, and do laundry. I also got to visit vineyards at a relaxed pace. If you pass by Twizel, stop by High Country Salmon and stock up on salmon (fresh, cold smoked, hot smoked).  I'm returning in late April to visit more vineyards in Central Otago, North Canterbury, Nelson/Tasman, Wairarapa, and Waipara.

Reddit,Month-long solo journey to New Zealand (South Island) late Feb-March. Looking for perspective,Dharmabud,"I toured the South Island in January and February of 2001. It was warm enough for shorts and a Tshirt. But at night a light jacket was good.  
 I rented a car and camped at some wonderful campgrounds. I was okay with the tent. Once in while I would splurge and stay in a hotel. I don’t think you need a camper.  
 I also did the Dart Track, Abel Tasman and Routeburn. When trekking I either stayed in huts or my tent.  
 Abel Tasman was awesome but it was a little crowded. I spent only a few days in Christchurch which was plenty. As you probably know, the area around Queenstown has a lot of adventure activities. The two that I did were a jet boat ride and cave rafting.  
 The cave rafting was cool because once inside the cave you floated on inner tube and saw these glow worms on the ceiling. My headlamp died but surprisingly I didn’t freak out. The other interesting thing is that the claustrophobia didn’t affect me.",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1qb5xhq/monthlong_solo_journey_to_new_zealand_south/

You can hire ebikes in Clyde and there are quite A few companies that do packages with accommodation at B+Bs, rustic hotels etc and return shuttles.  Its super fun. 
 Golden bay is often overlooked but there are really nice beaches (ligar bay, pohara or Tata beach) and heaps of great day and multi day hikes.  You can get out to Farewell spit, do a day (or more) of the able tasman NP walk from Wainui.  Theres some amazing river holes to swim in. 
 Stay in Takaka or maybe collingwood.  Check out the caves (go on a quick tour) to see Moa bones on Takaka Hill. 
 Places like Hanmer springs and Maruia springs are worth stopping at or staying for a night - both for the hot pools but also day hikes.

Reddit,I guide tours in Morocco. Stop treating everything like a scam.,TheGringaLoca,"Same. I was visiting friends in Catalonia but took a side trip to Seville. Couldn’t pass up the chance to see at least part of Africa. It was spontaneous, and since I was traveling alone I went guided day trip. The whole trip took nearly 20 hours. Drive from Seville to port. Ferry to Tangiers. Drove to the Key of Gibraltar, followed by lunch in town. Great group, and nice guides. Some of the group were harassed while we stopped at a scenic lookout offering short camel rides. The family was from Mexico, and were having trouble getting away. I went over and pretended I was with them and got them away. These hagglers weren’t the worst, but they turned nasty pretty quick. The guides didn’t really do a good job keeping them away, even though it was a small group and we were the only ones at the lookout. 
 After lunch we explored the Kasbah. The guides took us into a rug shop. I read a review on Viator saying that they really pushed a hard sell in the rug stores. They kept us there for probably 45 minutes. They made us sit upstairs (far from the doors to freedom) like school kids on the floor while they paraded out all the rugs. Me and another lady thought we’d buy something small, but even the tiniest little placemat was exorbitantly overpriced. It was a complete waste of our time and no one in our group bought anything. And they make you go into the workshop. It’s like if you don’t you’re on your own and you’ll be separated from the group.  
 We then headed into the main shopping street before heading back down to the port. I went into one shop and bought a tunic. The shopkeeper was very kind. As I was closing up my crossbody bag and walking out the door the shopkeeper told me to stop and make sure everything was put away before I stepped out on the street. I appreciated that reminder. I was in a hurry because we spent so damn long in the rug shop we had very little time to look at any of the other shops. 
 The worst was the hagglers by the buses. They were in your face. We had already all done our shopping and the trip had been 10+ hours at this point. When people politely declined, they called us “stupid fucking Americans.” Incidentally we were a mixed group: Aussies, Mexicans, Brits, and a few Americans.  
 It wasn’t a terrible experience. I enjoyed the trip for what it was. But there’s a reason why people are afraid to be scammed or trust people.  
 I understand it’s part of traveling, especially when coming from a place of privilege, and I also understand cultural experiences like haggling (I’m married to a South American, I’m well-versed in the art of the bargain). Generally, I tried to keep a low profile with my head down and say “La, shukran” and avoided eye contact.  
 Our ferry ended up being delayed for a few hours, and when we finely made it back to the ship I wanted to change out of my sweaty clothes. I made sure I dressed culturally appropriate for the occasion— long pants and a tunic. I swapped the pants for some linen shorts. It was mid-July, so scorching out. The shorts seemed to draw some unwanted attention. But maybe I was just on high alert after a day of being barraged from every angle. But, there were awesome people among the not so great. And I didn’t have the time or opportunity to get to explore outside of the city or into smaller neighborhoods.",6,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qbde8v/i_guide_tours_in_morocco_stop_treating_everything/

 And yes, this does ruin the experience for some people. As you point out, people worry so much about getting scammed that they don't enjoy themselves. Even more don't go at all because of this reputatio.

 I was in Marrakech for a week maybe 15 years. I got manhandled for not giving the dude with a monkey 100 euros for taking a photo with him. I got cornered in the back of a store by a group of teens wanting my iPod. I got extorted by a 12 year old when I asked him directions. He intentionally got me lost and then demanded money. When I did get away a guy on a motorcycle offered me a ride then blocked the taxi cab from picking me up and was yelling at me. I got followed back to my hotel by a male prostitute in the Jemaa el-Fnaa. I had a taxi driver try and short change me. I had another taxi driver claim the price he quoted was per person when we agreed on a price to go someplace. I had booths short change me, small amounts, so I let it go. I could not walk through the souks without being harrassed by salespeople.  
 I've travelled all over the world. I've had unpleasant experience in different destinations here and there. Never in my life have I had the need to be constantly on my guard and hyper vigilant against scammers and conmen like I did in Marrakech.  
 ""They asked me how much I was getting paid to take them there"" They ask that because it 1000% happens. I've been stuck on tours where they blow off half the schedule because they wanted to stop at a fucking rock or silver shop. Kickbacks for bringing people shopping is the norm, don't act indignant when people know the common tourist scams.

Reddit,I guide tours in Morocco. Stop treating everything like a scam.,Krasnodar_,"All these comments repeating the tired lines about scammers…yeah, they’re everywhere. I went with my older/borderline elderly mother and have nothing but love and respect for Morocco. Did Morocco have some sketchy people/scammers? Sure, but where doesn’t? We’re American (sorry, world) and experienced nothing other than acceptance, generosity, hospitality, and kindness.  
 Examples:  
 In the Marrakech souk, my mom thoughtlessly put her phone in the mesh water bottle sleeve in her backpack. A shopkeeper pulled her aside to let her know she should not keep it there, as it might get stolen. This was not a guy whose shop we were even browsing in—he motioned us in from the crowd of people moving through the alleyway to tell her.  
 In El Jadida and Essaouira, the fishermen fed the leftover scraps of fish to stray cats. I’ve always believed the tenet that you can judge a country on how it treats its animals, and Morocco’s gentleness towards them blew me away, particularly when compared to many Latin American and Caribbean destinations (and having rescued numerous dogs from Mexico/Trinidad and Tobago/Guatemala).  
 The hospitality is real. Americans don’t deserve it. But Moroccans offered it everywhere we went. I only wish the US could be as kind and welcoming as Morocco was. I honestly can’t recommend visiting enough.

Reddit,Why you should travel solo to Jujuy Argentina,becks2605,"They are both high-altitude deserts but the similarities end there. I did love Atacama but it is very curated. Most of what you do there revolves around pre-packaged tours out of San Pedro, the aesthetic backpacker town. Sunrise, flamingos, stargazing, swimming in salt lagoons with 40 other people, desert trekking, etc. There are a lot of places you can’t go without a tour group. It’s beautiful, and you should definitely experience it, but you’re kind of moving through a conveyor belt of highlights. There’s also a pretty big influencer and backpacker scene now. The ice cream in San Pedro though was delicious and had very local indigenous flavors that you truly cannot get anywhere else including Jujuy.  
 Jujuy is the deep cut and it has infrastructure that makes travelling totally doable. The best way to experience it is by renting a car and doing a road trip through it as well as the province below it, Salta. In Jujuy you are driving through villages, stopping wherever you want, wandering around, eating in places full of locals, and taking in landscapes without a schedule. The scenery is just as surreal as Atacama but you experience it quietly instead of in a group with a guide and a timetable. It was also less expensive.

Reddit,Travelling to France?

Walking around with a Starbucks is common in the U.S. (or a Tim's in Canada lol), but the French feel like coffee is something you should sit and enjoy. Chatting over coffee in the cafe or just sitting quietly and contemplating while you sip is a big part of the culture. 
 With the pronunciation, I find it's difficult for a lot of people. They should not ""roll their R's"" like a caricature French accent, but the throat bit is not easy unless you already speak a language like Arabic or Hebrew. What I tell people is not to lean into the ""r"", and not finish it. So not like ""bawn-jer"" like amateurs say, but like bow-(n)-zhoo-(r) where you barely pronounce the ""n"" and ""r"" - imagine only getting halfway thru those letters then just stopping.

 but this is also a great thing about france, we have a crazy diversity of culture and those differences are also part of France culture and uniqueness!",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qbqbg7/travelling_to_france_here_are_some_french/

Reddit,5 nights in Taipei wasn't enough. Absolutely fell in love,Sea_Dot8299,"Yup. Taiwan is 1000% underrated. Very affordable. Amazing food. Beautiful sites. Such cheap public transportation. An amazing bargain.  
 It is also way more laid back than Korea, China or Japan.  I also was often the only westerner for hours while walking through many areas. Westerners just seem not that interested in Taiwan for some reason.",3,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qboeko/5_nights_in_taipei_wasnt_enough_absolutely_fell/

Reddit,"First trip to South America (60M) - 18 days in Chile, Patagonia, and Argentina. Solo traveler",Ekay2-3,"-4 days is quite a bit in Santiago, and unless you’re checking out the vineyards or wineries, usually 1.5-2 days is enough  
 -can I recommend El Chalten and Torres Del Paine? If you like hiking these are some of the greatest places on earth, simply stunning. The trails are not easy but if you’re fit and like hiking and sensational nature, you can’t get better than this. El Chalten can be done in 2 nights from Calafate, which is pretty boring by itself, In Torres Del Paine there is the legendary W trek which is 4 days. I did both Fitz Roy and W Trek and both are worthwhile. There’s also day treks. Calafate takes 1 day to see the Perito Moreno and that’s all there is to. I’m not sure about the weather during the hikes in March however  
 -Another concern is that you can’t go direct from Santiago to Ushuaia and you’d have to transfer in BA. If I were you, I’d fly from Santiago to Puerto Natales to see Torres Del Paine, cross into Argentina and Calafate by bus, check out El Chalten and fly direct to Ushuaia from where you can fly to BA. It makes a nice loop. Also 7 days in BA is quite a bit. I thought 3 or 4 days in the city was alright. I didn’t go to Montevideo but from what I’ve heard it’s pretty laid back with not much to do. I did a boat day trip to Colonia which was alright",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qbqbtr/first_trip_to_south_america_60m_18_days_in_chile/

Reddit,"Hi neighbours, I need to ask for a favour.",Brief_Reaction8322,"Love you my friend and great respect for your grandparents may they rest in peace. Yar this topic is very close to my heart. Because I love my grandparents,  
 My grandfather left Ferozpur and settled in Kasur (a city just ~27Kms away), but my grandmother never forgot her life in Ferozpur. She'd often share stories about her friends and life there, and those memories stayed with her till her death.  
 My granfather used to tell than for about a year after Partition, things were relatively calm, and he was able to bring back grains and other essentials from their former home.  
 However, on his second trip, he was warned by people who worked under him not to return, as they let him go alive only because he was kind to them. 
 It's striking. Punjab and Bangal divided causing massive displacement.  
 I wish I could visit Ferozpur, though I know I won't find anyone who remembers my grandfather or great grandfather. I see, its a big city now, and time has moved on.",0,https://old.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/1qbwm8g/hi_neighbours_i_need_to_ask_for_a_favour/

 If you meant you'd continue selling online to your existing customers that should be fine.   
 Other than that yeah outside of researching the route look up visa and immigration requirements (like if you need to have proof of outward travel when entering, etc.).  Good luck!",2,https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1qbp8yb/solo_traveling_by_land_through_asia/
