Unfortunately, instead of modern infrastructure abd smart city planning, what we mostly see today is endless focus on heavy non-vegetarian, oily street food and superficial content creation. Compare this with India, where cities like Chandigarh, Gurugram, Noida, Dehradun, and Naya Raipur etc (more than 100 cities) have transformed remarkably in the post-independence era. Pakistan has not done justice to Lahore’s immense potential—it deserves far more than just narrow streets and food vlogs there!

@madanmathur6589,I was born in Lahore in 1931 and had to leave my motherland in 1947 due to historical events beyond our control. All these years I have been longing to visit my birth place (on Mohan Lal Road) but alas it has not been possible. Now at the age of 89 seeing your wonderful documentary my heart is full of nostalgia and fond memories of this historic city which seems to have have become younger and lovelier with passage of time. As someone has rightly said : “ Jis Lahore nahin dekheya o jamya hi nahin”! God bless you Lahore!(From India).,238,2020-11-10T16:14:13Z,True

Second the guy who mixes it with the wooden spoon is mixing it along with all the previous dirt he already mixed in there. I had severe food poisoning for a week had to he hospitalized after this.

@VedantYadav-p5x,"The fact that there are only two operational temples in all of Lahore makes me more rigid in my faith. As a Hindu, it pains me to know that the once wealthiest community in Lahore is now reduced to relying on just two temples. It fuels my anger and resentment when I see that India has the highest number of mosques in the world and that the Waqf Board is the third-largest landowner in the country. Meanwhile, my fellow Hindus are left with just two temples.
This is not about the mindset of two different countries towards their respective minorities; rather, it is about how a majority treats its own minorities. 😐I feel both fear and anger—anger at the fact that despite everything being so evident, people sit silently as if they know nothing, and fear because my own people have abandoned the reality of their past and are busy with their lives. They coexist without resentment with those who have repeatedly attacked our faith, raped our women's, and  waged war against us with betrayal and deceit. Sikhs have forgotten the sacrifices of the Sikh Gurus, hindus forgotten plight of Kashmiri Pandits, and the countless injustices our religion has suffered—be it the Jizya tax or the horrifying reality of our women being sold in markets throughout history.""And those who say, 'It’s history, forget it,' I feel like ripping their tongues out. Their voice doesn’t even tremble while saying this—they don’t stop to think about how their own ancestors once fought to protect our faith.""How must they have lived in an era where only Hindus were forced to pay taxes? The very people because of whom the practice of 'ghunghat' started in Hinduism, because of whom Hindus resorted to child marriage for their daughters, and even the horrific tradition of Sati Pratha""😡😣",0,2025-02-27T06:22:27Z,True

It is quite unfortunate that misinformation is spread in India about Pakistan not letting hindus live peacefully. You all need a reality check. At the time of partition mass scale population exchange was done between both punjabs. Almost all hindus moved from pakistani punjab to indian punjab and haryana and almost all muslims moved vice versa. There's hardly any hindus living in Lahore, so it's logical that there's only 2 operational mandirs. Supply and demand
Another lie spread is 14% population was hindu. It was never more than 3%, and almost all of them live in rural sindh. Numbers briefly decreased due to population exchange and the entire time since then hindu population has grown in number.
Lies are spread in Indian media and education curriculum only to create hatred for Pakistan.",0,2025-02-26T18:12:56Z,True

Dear friends, 
After hearing about your celebration of BASAVA JAYANTI at UK on 11th may2024, it is an immense pleasure for me to congratulate all of your esteemed team those who are propagating the universal philosophy of LINGAM DHARMA which is not a religion like others. This dharma was founded by his highness Appa SanganaBasavanna along with 1,96,000 propogaters called PRAMATHAS and 770 different Proffession sociospritual leaders called AMARA GANAS during 12th century. The philosophy speaks and practices about the egalitarian society where every individual is equally respected. Also the philosophy is based on scientific temper with rational thinking and high regard to humanity. It never speaks and discard about the belief that there is GOD or ALLAH or BHAGHAVANTA staying at imaginary Heaven and Hell which the foolish people of this world are believing. Every human individual is capable of becoming immortal by means of transcendental meditation using their own semicircular blackbody called KARALINGAM a physical miniature of wisdom. Thank-you. SHARANARTHY. BY JAGANATHAPPA PANSALE, PEETHADHIPATI, ALLAMAPRABHU ANUBHAVA PEETHA, WESTERN COASTAL OF BHARAT NATION.

They had a huge property with 2 havelis on 4 Lake Road. Since you are such an avid historian of Lahore, I was wondering if you might be able to send me any pictures or historical information of my ancestors. I don't know if there are records available at all? I look forward to hearing from you.

You can enjoy the same dishes at restaurants that at least look visibly clean. 

Avoid eating from random stalls. Even if a roadside stall looks clean, the pollution in the air can contaminate the food and cause food poisoning or other infections, especially if tap water is used.

@chozusmakavelli,"I'll tell you what made you sick:-
with any spice meal you need to balance it with any combination of cucumber, onions, yoghurt or lassi, to balance the heat from spice/meat/oil in your stomach. You need to balance the Geoff you eat.
Spice + spice + spice = explosions.
Raw onions in particular are a necessity with spicy food, they help with digestion. You're supposed to have a strand or two with every bite.
When we eat curry/biryani we alternate one bite with onion, one bite with cucumber.
Nearly every restaurant is on cloud coocoo land, they're supposed to give you salad with everything, but they don't unless you ask them, mofo's are ""dain bread"" (brain dead in ghetto), and goo oblivious to even advise you.
Most restaurants/eateries overload the spices/oil in everything so avoid eating too much spice and too much meat. 
if you get around to having a home cooked meal somewhere you will see the difference - you won't get sick from a home cooked meal.
Also don't overeat, avoid anything with mince meat, keep hydrated, eat plenty of fruit.",0,2025-11-14T09:33:22Z,True

@qasimaslam60,"Just as the jeweler used to set the price of the diamond in those days. Orhira was also called a beautiful girl. Which in those days, Nawabs used to come from far away and set the price. That is why it is called Heera Mandi, Taxila Gate Lahore was not all Heera Mandi. Many noble people used to live here. Yazdan TV Valve you don't know anything about Taxilagate. You are just talking about 30 years old things. And you don't know the real things or you are too afraid to say them. We have been residents of Bhatigate since 100 years. The diamond market is built by Muslims. Before the creation of Pakistan, the diamond market used to be held in Anarkali when the British saw that Muslims were so luxurious. And would come there and watch songs and dances and commit adultery with those girls. When the British stopped the Muslims from doing such work in the darkness of the night, they did not stop. Do it so that you feel ashamed, but they did not feel ashamed even today these are the people of Pakistan.",3,2023-08-07T10:08:33Z,True

They sucked blood of ruled people by imposing heavy taxes or by illegal occupation of their lands and properties to punish. They led luxurious lives and spent crores on wars. They stole costly belongings of people of other religions. They stole valuables from Hindu  temples,  Hindu Kings and other rich Hindu people.

This is especially true at a place like Jeela, which gets - how to put this delicately? - the most ignorant element of society made up of the most credulous and uneducated people who are impressed with his cheap tricks.

@Sam12345-o,"Hey Katie, 

I feel sorry upon how men were treating you inappropriately in this video. In all honesty, I am totally enraged. It's highly inappropriate to touch someone without their consent, let alone if it's a woman. In a Pakistani culture and also Islamically speaking, it's considered to be highly inappropriate when a man does that. If you are not related to a man,  e.g. if you're not their mother, daughter ,wife or sister; they are not even supposed to come into your radius or they are supposed to interact with you at a safe distance.

 You need to be more proactive about this and start yelling at them, on top of your lungs, and ask them to "" pee-chey Hut-toh ( step back)"". And stare back at them ( with your eyes popped out) . Please be very careful. 

Also the people you met in the video ,they are mostly lay men workers or underprivileged. They are illetrate ,uneducated and basically frustrated in their lives ( usually financial reasons ).

It's just like you're in America and in the middle of hillbillies , who are primarily homeless. So you can only imagine how unsafe that can be to be around them. So do not to go alone in the historic places. It's always a good idea to be escorted by someone or go in a group.

Does anyone remember Vespas and the Honda 175s? Classic 2 wheelers.  My family moved to the US in 1982. The first time I visited Pakistan after moving there was in 2008 and it was quite a shock. The old Pakistan I knew no longer existed.  The overpopulation, traffic and the mentality of the people was radically different from what I remember from the 1970s and 1980s.

Grindlays & Standard Chartered, both are British Banks,  respectively founded in 1828 and 1853.

Rest of the Info is here 👇
Standard Chartered acquired Grindlays Bank from ANZ in 2000, and the Grindlays name was phased out as the two banks integrated. This acquisition significantly expanded Standard Chartered's presence in South Asia and the Middle East. Although the Grindlays brand is no longer in use, the integrated operations, especially in private banking, now operate under the Standard Chartered name.",0,2025-11-09T19:36:46Z,True

@economicsadda7376,"A legend based on oral traditions holds that Lahore, known in ancient times as Nokhar (City of Lava in Sanskrit),[1] was founded by Prince Lava,[2] the son of Goddess Sita and Lord Rama; Kasur was founded by his twin brother Prince Kusha.[3] To this day, Lahore Fort has a vacant Lava temple dedicated to Lava (also pronounced Loh, hence Loh-awar or ""The Fort of Loh"").[4Lord Rama fighting Lava and Kusha.

The oldest authentic document about Lahore was written anonymously in 982. It is called Hudud-i-Alam (The Regions of the World).[5] In 1927 it was translated into English by Vladimir Fedorovich Minorsky and published in Lahore. In this document, Lahore is referred to as a small shehr (city) with ""impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards."" It refers to ""two major markets around which dwellings exist,"" and it also mentions ""the mud walls that enclose these two dwellings to make it one."" The original document is currently held in the British Museum.[6] Lahore was called by different names throughout history. To date there is no conclusive evidence as to when it was founded. Some historians trace the history of the city as far back as 4000 years ago.[7] However, historically, it has been proved that Lahore is at least 2,000 years old. Lying on the main trade and invasion routes to South Asia, Lahore has been ruled and plundered by a number of dynasties and hordes. Ganga Ram is regarded as ""the father of modern Lahore"". siyapati ramchandra ki jai 🙏",1,2022-05-30T13:30:04Z,True

Biryani usually are full of flavor and spices. Shami Kebab in pulao are made with mixture of lengils and chicken/beef. The reason for pulao kebab having so many reviews and famous is, First it is very affordable, secondly it is better for eating daily compared to biryani due to less spices and affordability.

It is culturally considered the heart of Pakistan. It is famous for its historical heritages, such as Badshahi Mosque and Lahore Fort.

@satyammishra2090,"Lesser Known Fact:

There’s a small town on KPK’s M1 called Lahor near Swabi. 

Known by few to once have been an ancient town on the Indus carrying immense historic importance for the Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims of South Asia. 

A town of scholars, monks, and warriors 1/n (🧵)

Lahor, also known as Chota Lahore, is a small town lying near the confluence of the Kabul and Indus rivers in KPK. 

However in the ancient times this town was known as Salatura, home of the grammarian Panini, the Monk Marananta, and the last town of Al-Muhallab’s foray.

Panini was an ancient Hindu grammarian from Salatura who lived between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE and was one of the first people in the world to work on descriptive linguistics and certainly the first to write a treatise on Sanskrit grammar.

His work consisting of over 3000 aphorisms, the Astadhyayi, marks the transition from Vedic Sanskrit to classical Sanskrit and was used for centuries after him and won him much acclaim even from modern linguists. 

There was apparently a statue of him in Salatura at some point.

Marananta was a Buddhist monk from Salatura credited to be amongst the first to introduce Buddhism to the Korean Peninsula in the late 4th century. 

Using the Silk Road, Marananta is believed to have travelled from Gandhara through China to reach the Korean Peninsula in 384 CE.

Marananta travelled to the kingdom of Baekje and preached Buddhism to the royal house and with support of the ruler built the kingdom’s first Buddhist temple and trained 10 monks. About a century and a half later, Buddhism in Baekje would reach its golden era.

Though pertinent to mention is that by further research I’ve discovered the generally accepted theory of Marananta being from Salatura to have a rather weak basis. There needs to be further work conducted by Korean and Pakistani archaeologists and historians in this regard.

Salatura was also one of the few south Asian cities to be mentioned in the early Islamic historiographical work the “Futuh Al-Buldan” and also one of the first towns in the region to witness Muslim activity due to the foray Al-Muhallab.

Al-Muhallab Ibn Sufra was an Muslim general who led the first charge of the Muslims into today’s Khyber Pukhtunkhwa in 644 CE during the rule of the Huns. 

The historian Baladhuri mentions 2 cities: Al-Bannah (Bannu Basin) and Al-Ahwar (Lahor/Salatura).

Though the attack was successful, no permanent hold over the region was made but an important possible strategic aim was achieved. Forces of Zabulistan were possibly scattered and barred from regrouping against Ibn Samura’s siege which lead to the fall of Kabul to the Muslims.

Though due to a dearth of information we don’t know how large of an effect this foray till Salatura had but the existence of early Islamic tombs, mentions of Muslims traders in Hund and the later tomb of Sinan Ibn Salmah show us that the Muslim activity in the region increased.

Though Salatura would find another possible mention later on by some historians, it’s importance vaned even further with time. 

It is all but a small town on the motorway now, a small town with a small secret of its extremely illustrious past.",0,2024-10-22T14:17:18Z,True

Where history and modernity gleams,
With treasures of art and culture so rare,
And a soul that's vibrant, alive and aware.

In the ancient walls of Lahore Fort,
Mughal grandeur and glory still court,
While Badshahi Mosque stands tall and proud,
A marvel of faith, beauty, and crowd.

The bustling bazaars of Anarkali,
And the lanes of Food Street so jolly,
Are a feast for senses and appetite,
With flavors and colors that ignite.

From the stunning Shalimar Gardens' grace,
To the peaceful Wazir Khan Mosque's embrace,
Lahore's architecture is a sight to behold,
A blend of past, present, and stories untold.

The people of Lahore are warm and kind,
Their hospitality knows no bind,
With a love for food, music, and dance,
And a zest for life that's infectious, by chance.

Lahore, city of gardens and dreams,
Where every corner a history beam,
A city that's alive, with a heart so true,

Thanks for ur nice nice vlogs. Beautiful footages, droneshots, pics n storytelling.
I like ur Punjabi mix Urdu talks, soft n clear in nature. U do lots of research n show maximum scenic n sightseeing spots.
I am following u since ur Germany to Pakistan ride. An epic n interesting, scenic ride. Thanks for all.
In this vlog u hv mentioned about son of Prabhu Ram (Our God).
Just I want to correct u in pronouncing the correct name. Prabhu Ram had 2 sons, a twin. Named Lav n Kush. It is Lav (pronounced as 'Love' in English).
Sorry for this correction thing but this Lahore historic city vlog is quite informative n nice.

@amarnathjha8319,"I love Lahore, Lahoriat friends in USA and Lahore stories.
Lahore was originally LUVPURAM and this City(NAGAR) was eastablished by Shri Luv, older son of Shri Ram of Bharatbarsh (with capital at Ayodhya).
Mere priya Lhori dost, Hindu Muslim, Sikh Budh jhagre se uper utho aur apne Itihas(TARIKH) ko pahchano aur use sahi sahi apne children ko transfer karo.
JO koum apni Tarikh bhul jati hai wo Tarikhi panne se hat jati hai. Apak itihas bahut purana hai. Ancient time se LUVPURAM (Lahore) wahin khara hai. Pahle Vedic Arya ne ise basaya, fir Budh ne age barhaya, fir Islam ne ise aur naye naye buildings jorkar age barhaya. Fir Sikhon ne age barhaya. Fir Angrej ne aakar aur bistar diya. 
Pure duniya ke log Lahore aana chahte hain. Yadi Egypt aur Greece tourist map par hai  to Lahore ko bhi hona chahiye. 
Ab Lahore ko kisse khatra hai?Ise duniya ka top business center banye. English aur Urdu ke sath sath Sanskrit ko jinda kijiye.
Sanskrit ko Byakaran(grammar) dene bale koi aur nahi, balki Lahori Shri Panini  hi to the!.
Lahore ke Tarikh per research hona chahiye. Is per kitaben likhi jani chahiye.

@Sololife07,"A Hindu legend based on oral traditions holds that Lahore, known in ancient times as Nokhar (City of Lava in Sanskrit),[1] was founded by Prince Lava,[2] the son of the goddess Sita and Rama; Kasur was founded by his twin brother Prince Kusha.[3] To this day, Lahore Fort has a vacant Lava temple dedicated to Lava (also pronounced Loh, hence Loh-awar or ""The Fort of Loh"").[4] It is one of various etymological theory of Lahore's origin.

Rama fighting Lava and Kusha.
The oldest authentic document about Lahore was written anonymously in 982. It is called Hudud-i-Alam (The Regions of the World).[5] In 1927 it was translated into English by Vladimir Fedorovich Minorsky and published in Lahore. In this document, Lahore is referred to as a small shehr (city) with ""impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards."" It refers to ""two major markets around which dwellings exist,"" and it also mentions ""the mud walls that enclose these two dwellings to make it one."" The original document is currently held in the British Museum.[6] Lahore was called by different names throughout history. To date there is no conclusive evidence as to when it was founded. Some historians trace the history of the city as far back as 4000 years ago.[7] However, historically, it has been proved that Lahore is at least 2,000 years old. Lying on the main trade and invasion routes to South Asia, Lahore has been ruled and plundered by a number of dynasties and hordes.",0,2024-08-31T15:06:06Z,True

He wanted to abandon us and i always was a house wife, when i did work i invested in a home, my earnings are very low and its not right to play around just for the reason because someone has decided to find someone else while in marriage. The least he could do was provide for our kids' food. Life for females is different. Most men don't want used goods.. but that's not the point. He knew i was from very poor and broken background with basic education in islam and academic. I feel i was unfairly treated and it caused us to live in more poor state. Its sad to say islam was not followed properly in terms of being a muslim husband and good provider. It was not met and i fell inlove for real whole i was being played frim young age till half of my lifes gone😢.. may Allah make it easy for sisters and brothers in this state and do keep me and my kids in duas, prayers ameen❤",0,2025-07-13T19:02:03Z,True

@Gulchih,"Keep a towel with you during the daytime for your mum, love. Heatstrokes are common at this time of year and she needs something to protect her from direct sunlight. She should wear a light shrug too but a white towel to cover the torso is necessary if going outside during the peak sun hours. I fainted once in the outdoor market as I didn't take it seriously. Also after returning to your room don't shower straight away, the sudden temperature change in the body can cause blood vessels to expand and cause hemorrhage, God forbid. Wait 15 mins and then shower if you need to. And remember to drink lots of liquid especially lemonade, which has some sugar & salts because in sweating a lot of the body's salts are lost.

15. But if they pressure you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of,1 do not obey them.

We being Muslims men are taught to lower our gazes when we see any Naa Mahram (Female outside your own family, (wife,mom,sis, daughter, aunts - these are mahram). Same is the case of women when they see a Naa mahram man.

Cities like Lahore are chaotic, hectic & overwhelming. You will make your life difficult in this chaos. Its just a suggestion. I live in Islamabad. To make quality content your focus should remain on north. If you ever plan to come back, Do a 'hitchhiking' series in north Pakistan. Cities like Lahore/Karachi/Rawalpindi are not great for making content. They are overcrowded cities where there is no peace of mind.

One thing I can assure you that they have innocent intentions, they are just happy that travellers from across the globe coming to visit their country. And they like to take pictures with you so they can prove that they met an international traveler, when they tell their story to someone.

You put an artistic effort to your vlogs.

I had the privilege of visiting Pakistan in December of last year, and I must express that it was an exceptionally rewarding experience. Despite having traveled to numerous countries, I found Pakistan to be particularly enchanting, largely due to the warmth and hospitality of its people. The genuine kindness and open-heartedness exhibited by the Pakistani people left an amazing impression on me, and I hold fond memories of the gracious welcome extended to me during my time there. Pakistan holds a special place in my heart, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have experienced its rich culture and hospitality firsthand.Wanna say something more....The natural beauty of pakistan is something else..I think if pak govt looks forward i think pakistan can become number 1 for tourists...I visited kashmir,KPK and skardu in pakistan...The natural beauty of all these places gave me peaceful vibe.. Pakistan is the only country where i wanna go again and again..The hospitality of poor people in pakistan even if they don't have personal houses,was unbelievable..Even after telling them that i am a Hindu still they treated me like a king....

Saffron (Kesari) Top Band Courage, Sacrifice, Strength, and Renunciation. It signifies selflessness and the readiness to put the nation's interest first. The rising sun, fire, warmth.
White Middle Band Peace, Truth, and Purity. It stands for honesty, clarity, and the path of righteousness. Clouds, moonlight, the Himalayas.
Green Bottom Band Fertility, Prosperity, Growth, and Auspiciousness. It represents the nation's connection to its soil, vegetation, and a vibrant life. Land, agriculture, forests, and plant life.
Navy Blue Centre (Ashoka Chakra) Sky, Ocean, and Eternal Movement. It represents the wheel of law (Dharma), signifying constant progress and dynamism.

@roopeshkotian4432,"Bro, compare neck to neck...not randomly.
If you bring Islamabad into the discussion, put it against Mumbai:
street food vs street food, hotels vs hotels, nightlife vs nightlife.

I live in Mumbai — come here and I’ll show you the real city, from iconic street food to classic hotels and pubs.
Maharashtra alone has layers: Mumbai’s city vibe, Lonavala & Mahabaleshwar’s hill views, heritage spots, modern hospitality & everything.

And let’s talk facts:
Today’s new India has more than 15 strong, classic cities.
India has around 44 UNESCO sites, while Pakistan has 6 — and even their famous ones like Mohenjodaro & Taxila are historically tied to ancient Indian culture ( that also pakistani destroyed...they can't build but they are good in destroying )

So stop making half-baked comparisons.
Sorting through old Indian streets and judging the entire country is just lazy analysis.

Indian drivers are not smart and not considerate the road manners very bad. I also ride but I very rarely honk unless it is like unavoidable situation. I ride with the mindset that I am not in a hurry and take my time but in India people ride like they are having an emergency all the time but it's just a normal day to day situation. In India people bike even to walkable distance shops rather than taking a stroll and enjoying it even that they will do like an emergency.

Let me share why Pakistan excels in ethics and hospitality, while India leads in infrastructure and development.

In India, the political system, bureaucracy (both civil and military), and government institutions generally have stronger governance and comparatively lower levels of corruption than in Pakistan. This contributes to better development and infrastructure.

On the other hand, the hygiene, hospitality, and lower tendency for scamming in our culture come from strong Islamic teachings on honesty, cleanliness, and moral conduct, values considered an essential part of faith. These principles shape people’s behavior and create a more ethical environment.",0,2025-11-25T04:16:47Z,True

@jaybharat7924,"​""Let me add one more thing: when India and Pakistan were to be partitioned by the British, both countries were to be separated on the basis of religion, with Muslims in Pakistan and Hindus in India. But some of our foolish leaders, bravely showing their audacity—famously known as the Gandhi-Nehru duo—allowed the Muslim people to settle here. Pakistan became a Muslim nation, but India remained a secular country for all religions and could not become a Hindu nation. Today, India is suffering a huge loss because of this; their population has increased from 9% to 25%, and the Hindu population has come down from 82% to 69%. These people obstruct basic amenities, they do not follow any laws, nor the Constitution or the National Anthem. They continuously engage in anti-national activities by talking about Islamic Sharia law in everything, and some of our dirty politicians keep them as their crown jewels for the sake of votes. Otherwise, India would have been among the developed nations much earlier.""",0,2025-11-24T16:49:08Z,True

@jaybharat7924,"Hi,
The reason for this is that 25% of Muslims live in India and they do not consider India as their country, they do not accept the Constitution of India, they do not sing the national anthem, they hate everything that is done for the good of India. Most of the dirt and garbage you find in India will be near Muslim neighborhoods or where the Muslim population is high. These people will throw garbage directly on the road, chicken feathers, bones, feet, either on the road or near the riverbank. These people pelt stones at every new train in India, tear seats, place big stones or cut treetrunks on the rail tracks. They run the biggest network of fake currency notes to harm India. These people oppose the Uniform Civil Code, and they believe in Sharia law instead of the Constitution of India. Only these people carry out terrorist attacks all over India. They are high-tempered fighters. My intention in saying this is that if these people were not there, you would not be able to complain about India so much. If you find what I said wrong, you can Google it. Thank you.""",1,2025-11-24T16:32:47Z,True

Islam religion is about cleanliness I'm speaking unbiased as I'm Indian myself and I'm not Muslim. Yet I see clearly why Pakistani people will obviously be more clean. India isnt focussed on cleanliness and unfortunately a lot of Indian youtubers in other parts of the world will mention about terrible grooming hygiene of Indians their body odour and personal hygiene, India religions like Hinduism don't have a handbook of how to keep clean of personal hygiene whereas in Islam there are a set of rules to follow. I see them in London the indian students always smelling bad with body odour whereas a Pakistani person will never smell bad I'm talking about the men especially.

Beshak, Pakistan ke log mehmaan-nawaaz hain, dil se acche bhi honge, par mehmaan-nawaazi ka matlab ye toh nahi ki hum itihas bhool jaayein, hum andhe ho jaayein? Jo mulk 26/11 ka ghayal Mumbai bhool gaya, Kargil me peeeth pe chhura maarne ka dukh bhool gaya, Pulwama ke shahidon ka gham bhool gaya, kya waha jaake sirf pyaali chai peene se sab kuch theek ho jaayega?

Aur sabse bada sawaal—jo log aaj wahan aapka swagat kar rahe hain, wahi ek samay pe usi same show me hamari Indian Army ka mazaak uda rahe the, unki shahadat ka मज़ाक बना rahe the. Kya journalism ka matlab ye hai ki jo hume maarne chale the, unhi se gale milne chale jaayein?

Sir, mujhe pata hai aap mujhse zyada gyaani, samajhdaar aur anubhavshali hain, lekin ek Indian youth hone ke naate, ye sawaal mere dil me hai. Desh bhakti ka matlab sirf border pe ladna nahi hota, kabhi kabhi sach bolne ka bhi hota hai.

Aapke jawaab ka intezaar rahega.

Regards,
(Waseem khan)",0,2025-02-27T14:09:50Z,True

@GmasifAli-m6y,"🎉believe that the world had been hiding Pakistan’s true beauty for a long time, and only in the past one or two years have YouTubers begun to properly explore the country. The international media had created an image that Pakistan is a place full of terrorism and danger, labeling it as one of the most unsafe countries. But when YouTubers actually explored Pakistan, they discovered that the people here are incredibly hospitable — especially those from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Punjab, Balochistan, and even Sindh. People warmly welcome visitors from abroad, whether they come from the UK, Canada, or any other country.

I have seen thousands of YouTubers exploring Pakistan, and I would encourage others to check their experiences as well. Pakistan should have been ranked among the top-rated countries in the world, yet its position is 101. This under-rating is mainly due to the false narrative spread by international media, which has overshadowed the country’s real beauty and hospitality.",0,2025-11-18T07:52:50Z,True

@IWouldEat,"Eating food outside too much, know the side effects.
*********************************************************
Often people are fond of eating outside, people enjoy outdoor eating with their friends and family. At the same time, some people have the compulsion to eat outside. Students and professionals living alone away from their homes are forced to eat outside food. Everyday eating out is not good for your health. It can harm you in many ways. If you are planning to eat out with your friends today, it is better that you cancel your plans. It is not good for your own health.

Actually, you may not be aware of this fact, but eating out regularly can actually spoil your health. It increases the production of a chemical called phthalates in the body and damages your health in the worst way. It also upsets the natural hormonal balance and affects your overall health. In addition, there are many more factors that suggest that one should not eat out often or regularly. Let us know why eating outside is often not a healthy option.",0,2023-01-17T10:01:28Z,True

Similarly, if someone travels from Lahore to Peshawar or Karachi, they might not experience the same warm reception.
